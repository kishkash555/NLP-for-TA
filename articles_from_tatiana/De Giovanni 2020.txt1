ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a supply chain game that is composed of two firms, one supplier and one retailer. The
supplier sells goods to the retailer and sets the service strategy efforts. The retailer determines the optimal
quantity to purchase and the selling price. The supply chain can be managed through either a traditional
online platform or a blockchain. In the former, firms face business risks due to delivery and service and also
pay high transaction costs. In the latter, they work on a blockchain platform, remove all risks over the supply
chain, and save the transaction costs. However, the blockchain requires initial implementation investments as
well as variable costs. Furthermore, the firms gain in terms of visibility, transparency, and security, which are
summarized in tokens. We identify the conditions and the stochastic cases in which the blockchain is not worth
implementing. Then, we investigate the suitability of a smart wholesale price contract and a smart revenue
sharing contract to better coordinate firms’ relationships and negotiations. We highlight all cases in which
the use of smart contracts makes blockchain applications more operationally convenient and economically
appealing.

1. Introduction
The recent digital transformation that firms and supply chains have
experienced through Industry 4.0 technologies poses important strategic considerations and economic implications. The adoption of Industry
4.0 technologies has been both fashionable and appealing in recent
years due to their potential benefits and the role that they play in the
digital worlds (Ivanov et al., 2019a,b; Frank et al., 2019). However,
firms and supply chains require further analysis to better understand
such rapid and increasing trends, specifically, whether Industry 4.0
technologies supply real operational advantages and concrete market
opportunities (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Liu and De Giovanni, 2019)
or whether their adoption is only a contemporary tendency inspired
by the current technological progress and incentivized by generous
government development plans (Liao et al., 2017; Kiel et al., 2017). In
any case, it seems clear that firms and supply chains need a comprehensive analysis of the strategic behavioral changes required to properly
select and use Industry 4.0 technologies, an accurate estimation of their
economic outcomes, and a careful assessment of the implications for the
whole supply chain (Ivanov et al., 2019a,b; Saberi et al., 2019a; Ivanov
et al., 2016).
One popular technology that can effectively enable all Industry
4.0 applications in Supply Chain (SC) Management is the blockchain
(Kshetri, 2018). A blockchain consists of a set of digital applications
enabling firms and SCs to track, trace, and verify how goods tran-

sit and move along the supply (Casey and Wong, 2017), from the
manufacturers to retailers through distribution centers and logistics
facilities (Cole et al., 2019). Such shared information on a blockchain
platforms allows all supply chain members to be updated, integrated,
and involved in any transaction (Pournader et al., 2019). Today, SCs
are geographically very extended and dispersed, making the boundaries
of their business and competition difficult to even identify (Saberi
et al., 2019a). In addition to the intricate network of relationships
that firms can establish worldwide and that are complicated by the
use of Industry 4.0 technologies, issues like inefficient transactions and
suppliers’ performance, frauds and fake deals, cultural barriers and language differences, international regulations and legislative constraints,
lack of trust and commitment of some suppliers call for additional
information visibility, transparency, and verifiability to better manage
and control the supply chain network, remove all potential business
risks and mitigate the inefficient transactions characterizing the SC
linkages (Dolgui et al., 2019). Blockchains enable trustless networks,
because the parties can transact even though they do not trust each
other (Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016) .
Currently, SCs use traditional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
along with online platforms to manage the flows of goods, information,
and money. However, these Information Systems (IS) solutions cannot

business risks and transaction costs. In addition, increasing the number of tokens supplies even more economic advantages. Even though,
firms require a careful analysis of both the delivery and the consumer
risks when assessing the economic convenience of implementing a
blockchain. The delivery risk has a more important impact on the
supply chain profitability, while traditional online platforms can be
sufficient in absorbing the volatility linked to the consumers risks.
Furthermore, we characterize two scenarios in which the blockchain
has been developed to complement the current firms’ negotiations with
smart contracts using ethereum. First, we allow the blockchain to also
modify the wholesale price. That is, the retailer seeks to identify a
wholesale price increase that incentivizes the supplier to carry out
negotiations by using a blockchain. We identify the wholesale price
changes that allow the supplier to be economically better off with a
smart wholesale price contract, leading to the adoption of this technology for handling SC affairs. Furthermore, we characterize an SC game
in which the retailer offers a smart revenue sharing contract (RSC)
to the supplier. Generally, although highly efficient, RSCs are difficult
to implement in business because of the need to control and enforce
the other parties’ work. We identify the conditions of the smart RSC
to make all SC members economically better off independent of the
blockchain marginal cost.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature of
blockchains and SC management. Section 3 proposes the game theoretical models in which the SC can be managed on a traditional online
platform and with a blockchain application. In Section 4, we show
the equilibria for the games and compare the findings in Section 5.
Section 6 analyzes the business risks associated to traditional SCs and
their impact on the decision to implement blockchain technologies.
7 presents scenarios in which the blockchain is complemented with
smart contracts. Section 8 suggests managerial insights and Section 9
concludes, proposes extensions, and highlights the limitations of this
study.

control for a certain number of risks linked to business transactions,
ensure the full visibility and transparency of all SC members, or record
and make the transaction contents available to interested parties (Dolgui et al., 2018). IBM has proposed blockchain applications to the food
industry to assist the food transformation from origin to consumption
since food is constantly changing over the SC tiers so that firms and
society can know more about it. Several SC partners like Dole and
Walmart complement their ERP with blockchains to document and
make visible all information regarding how food originates, how it is
produced, how it is pushed along the SC, and how it is transported, with
the final objective to make food trustable (www.ibm.com). SAP proposes the use of blockchains in humanitarian logistics and SCs as they
allow systems to be connected. When relief agencies, governments and
non-governmental organizations send inputs (e.g., drugs, transportation
means, people) into a location affected by a disaster, the availability of
a blockchain allows all parties to trust the inputs from all locations and
to be informed on how the inputs are used. Therefore, each blockchain
participant knows whether all parties stick to the contractual terms
defined within the platform and adjust their decisions accordingly.
Finally, aids can be provided efficiently and further delays can be
avoided by removing all unnecessary decisions (www.sap.com).
To overcome the traditional IS limitations, firms and SCs can effectively use blockchain applications and pursue their digital transformation (Chakrabarti and Chaudhuri, 2017). Accurate analysis and
overall assessment of blockchain applications embrace both the positive
advantages and the negative implications for business, management,
operations, SCs and stakeholders (Cole et al., 2019). To achieve this
goal, this paper investigates the firms’ convenience of moving from a
traditional online platform to a blockchain application for managing SC
transactions. We start from a simple SC composed of one supplier and
one retailer, negotiating through an online system. The supplier informs
of its availability to sell products at a certain wholesale price; the
retailer decides the number of goods to be purchased from the supplier
and sets the selling price. The supplier takes care of all the post-sale
activities by investing in service. When firms use a traditional online
platform, they encounter two main drawbacks. First, each transaction
generates a marginal transaction cost, whose impact on the firms’ profits depends on the quantity moved across the SC and/or the good sold.
Second, managing relationships in a classical platform can generate
business risks that firms cannot control during the negotiation process.
The retailer, which is the firm most likely affected by the negative
implications of a tradition online platform, can decide to move to a
blockchain platform. The latter has the main objective of mitigating
the business risks in the SC, making the transactions secure, visible, and
transparent. Furthermore, this allows firms to fully save the transaction
costs existing in traditional negotiations. At the same time, blockchain
applications create new business implications for SCs. On the one hand,
the SC members face costs linked to the blockchain implementation and
management. On the other hand, the SC members gain a number of
tokens (option value) which is exemplified by the translation of information transparency, trust, security, and risk mitigation in economic
terms.
Our findings highlight the detrimental effects that both transaction
costs and business risks can have on SC performance. While the adoption of a blockchain clearly removes these negative effects, firms can
find its implementation and business implications economically inconvenient. The fixed cost for implementing a blockchain is not important
for firms because they can easily adjust their strategies to recover such
investment. Rather, the tokens and the marginal blockchain cost have
important business repercussions with the marginal cost being more
important than the tokens. Therefore, firms implementing a blockchain
should first evaluate the marginal costs: When those are high, the
blockchain should not be implemented because neither the number of
tokens nor the risk and transaction cost mitigation justifies its adoption.
However, if the marginal costs for a blockchain are affordable, all
SC members can be economically better off through simply removing

2. Literature review
Blockchain is a general purpose technology. The latter is defined
as a technology that plays the role of ‘‘enabler’’, opening up new
opportunities rather than offering complete, final solutions (Bresnahan
and Trajtenberg, 1995). Therefore, blockchain is a complementary
innovation since it supports existing innovations to reach goals never
achieved before. Sakoshi Nakamoto was the initiators of blockchain
technology, which was created to support bitcoin transactions and consisted of a distributed database able to maintain a continuously growing
list of records (blocks) from tampering or revision (Nakamoto, 2019).
Previous generations of technologies were most likely about fastening
and securely exchanging of information. Rather, blockchain is about
creating value by enabling firms and individuals to exchange assets
of any kind without relying of third party managing the transactions
(Mulligan et al., 2018).
Blockchain technology can effectively boost the value created in
SCs, in which the transactions occur at a global scale, there is uncertainty on a some operational features (e.g., delivery, last mile management, bullwhip effect), and traditional vendor rating procedures
can be ineffective in finding trusty parties (Babich and Hilary, 2019).
Blockchain enables the reduction of two significant costs that challenge
all supply chains: The cost of verifying the attributes of a transaction
and the cost of exchanging value within a network without relying
on intermediaries (Michelman, 2017). The transaction and verification
costs link to all issues arising when treating a transaction in supply
chain management. Currently, Blockchain can substantially help in this
regards, by allowing the distributed ledger to manage all these tasks,
hence ensuring security and trustworth of suppliers and transactions
(De Giovanni, 2019a). Therefore, blockchain can efficiently manage
all issues linked to settlement and reconciliation that can occur over
supply chains (Catalini and Gans, 2016). For example, blockchain

not at all superfast (Pournader et al., 2019), allow SC members to
finalize transactions faster than traditional exchange systems (Ivanov
et al., 2019a). Furthermore, blockchains eliminate all intermediate
actors over a certain transaction, leading to considerable cost savings
any time a transaction is carried out, independent of the country,
region, and distance. Hence, blockchains guarantee zero transaction
downtimes thereby ensuring SCs’ synchronization of flows, movements,
and operations (Morkunas et al., 2019).
Clearly, Blockchains are also characterized by several weaknesses
that SCs should consider before diving into such projects:
1. The implementation of blockchain applications requires that all
SC members take into account the complex regulatory, tax, auditability,
risk, and compliance implications linked to any global transaction
platform (Cole et al., 2019). Therefore, SCs need to hire highly skilled
and competent Blockchain developers to project, create, and implement
a blockchain contemplating the earlier mentioned features (Liao et al.,
2017). Accordingly, the implementation cost and time can proportionally increase according to the peculiar context in which the digital
application is supposed to work (Misra, 2018).
2. Blockchains are composed of networks of nodes and blocks.
Hence, when a node must to be processed, the application should
transversally come across all preceding nodes, process all intermediate
nodes, and then reach the target node (Ganeriwalla et al., 2018).
As a result, there is a continuous redundancy of processing nodes,
requiring time, energy, and, consequently, costs (Saberi et al., 2019b).
These implications can even be worsened by the procedure allowing SC
members to reach a consensus. Depending on the SC size as well as the
number of blocks and nodes, blockchains can request intense peer-topeer communications and exchanges to achieve a common consensus
(Büyüközkan and Göçer, 2018).
3. A blockchains consensus limits the total amount of transactions
that SC members can finalize in a given time. Clearly, firms have
opportunities to increase the transaction capacity per unit of time (distributed ledger technology) but this implies additional costs (Hofmann
and Rüsch, 2017). In addition, increasing the number of transactions
also implies rapid expansion of the blockchain size, causing a further
issue of capacity storage. SC members adopting blockchains must need
to define the parties that will manage and govern the distributed ledger
to identify the party responsible for system maintenance and upgrades
(Kshetri, 2018).
In this research, we seek to characterize a game theory model of
SC that embeds positive and negative business implications due to
blockchain. We start our investigation from the implementation and
analysis of a traditional supply chain that uses a conventional online
platform to finalize and manage transactions at a global scale. Then,
the adoption of blockchain technology is evaluated within the same
framework, by addressing the most relevant positive and negative
implications for SCs as emerged from Babich and Hilary (2019), Griffith
(2018) and Gurtu and Johny (2019), as well as by the empirical
research by van Hoek (2019). When applied to SCs, blockchain plays a
key role in enabling the reduction of transaction costs, eliminating of
delivery risks, mitigating of market uncertainty, and creating new value
through tokens. Furthermore, blockchain also implies implementation
investments, learning costs for firms that need to modify business
model, shifting the culture and modus operandi, operational practices and daily procedures. Finally, blockchain enables the adoption of
smart contracts through ethereum, which creates new challenges and
complexity linked to the identification of smart contract clauses and
terms. These features require the engineering of protocols and routines
that artificial intelligence and virtual machines run seeking to execute
procedures, verify conditions, and monitor suppliers’ acceptance and
performance. As explained by Barrera and Catalini (2018), searching
for all these features requires the use of game theory since firms’
interactions, frictions, incentives, objectives, penalties, and behavior
should all be included in the smart contract protocols. The comparison of traditional supply chain platforms with blockchain applications
allow us to highlight the operational and economic advantages of
blockchain technologies and define its boundaries of applications and
future developments.

can mitigate any supply chain issue linked to non-conform goods, by
generating payments and finalizing transactions only when conformity
is fully checked. In this sense, the use of blockchain technology preserves the brand value from possible deterioration due to quality issues
(De Giovanni, 2019b).
The second cost that blockchain aims at removing its the networking
cost, which are very popular in SC management. De Giovanni (2016)
build up on the Transaction Cost Theory by Williamson (1979) and
identify two cost categories that can be removed through blockchain
technology: Bargaining and enforcement costs. Bargaining costs are the
costs required to define an acceptable agreement with the other SC
party to a transaction or drawing up an appropriate contract in global
contexts. Enforcement costs are the costs of making sure the other party
sticks to the contractual terms, exemplified by the costs of controlling and monitoring the SC participants behavior and commitments.
Furthermore, blockchain enables the networking cost reduction by
acting on the cost of bootstrapping, operating, and scaling an economic
network (Catalini and Gans, 2016). Bootstrapping refers to subsidizing
mining via the block reward to get bitcoin to a stage where it is
relatively safe from hash rate related attacks. Operating costs link to the
ability to verify property rights, check the states, and define incentives
without the use of intermediaries. Scaling costs depend on the blocks
size and the block rate, which are inversely linked to the blockchain
security: high size (rate) leads to high (low) security (Greyblock, 2018).
Traditional research in SC management investigates the firms’ transactions and networking by mainly using game theory (cachon, 2003;
De Giovanni, 2009). However, after the advent of bitcoins and
blockchain through Nakamoto’s developments, no research has investigated blockchain technology in SCs using game theory, leaving a
research gap that we intend to fulfill. The current research in SCs linked
to blockchain is purely theoretical and qualitative, that is, it describes
what blockchain is, the possible benefits in operations and SC, the
limitations and barriers, and the future research directions (e.g., Babich
and Hilary (2019), Griffith (2018), Gurtu and Johny (2019); van Hoek
(2019)). Nevertheless, there is no research that evaluates and quantifies
the real benefits of blockchain by identifying and evaluating its positive
and negative implications for SCs. Regarding the points linked to SCs,
firms initiating blockchain projects can pursue the following benefits:
1. Blockchains are decentralized systems without any central authority controlling and supervising the transactions. Therefore, transactions among the SC members are fully visible and quickly exchangeable
without any central administrator permission (Chang et al., 2020).
The idea is that third parties like governments, intermediaries, and
banks are too vulnerable and can be easily attacked. The blockchain
advantages are then exemplified by cost savings of not having to hire
IS experts to prevent, control, and stop cyberattacks and eventually
restore the whole set of functionalities (Kiel et al., 2017).
2. Blockchains allow data, information and transactions to be visible
and transparent (Cole et al., 2019). Any SC member records transactions in the blockchain such that all other SC members can visualize
and keep track of all actions, affairs, and movements (Francisco and
Swanson, 2018). In addition, the records are immutable and unalterable, meaning that SC members’ actions and decisions are all recorded
and documented on the blockchain. When their actions imply good outcomes, all SC members become permanently aware of the correctness of
these actions. Also, when firms’ affairs lead to questionable outcomes
and arguable business implications, SC members keep track of them
and adjust their decisions in finalizing future transactions (Hawlitschek
et al., 2018). Therefore, SC members working through blockchains have
strong incentives to perform the best operations ever (De Giovanni,
2019a). Finally, the recorded transactions are immutable, or at least
they can be modified only when all firms, SC members, and stakeholders involved in the same transaction give their consensus (Kshetri,
2018).
3. Transactions with banks can take a long time and be quite
expensive (Misra, 2018). However, the current blockchains, which are

the retailer receives due to scant quality controls over the shipments.
𝜙 is the error linked to the lower amount that the supplier invests in
online service, for which the supply chain has not full knowledge since
the amount cannot be traced. We assume that both 𝛾 and 𝜙 are uniform
distributed in the domain (0,1] and the density functions are 𝑓 (𝑥) and
𝑓 (𝑦), respectively. Then, we use Firouzi et al.’s (2016) approach to
model the stochastic components. Therefore, the non-conforming rate

is 𝛼 (1 − 𝛾). We assume that the same structure applies for the service

– 𝑐𝑄 𝑄 ∕2 is the amount of money that the retailer invests

suppliers, displays the best wholesale price, 𝑤, and offers the product

𝐴′ s structure are also valid for 𝑄 . Note that we analyze a SC using
online platforms; therefore, as it happens for Amazon and Alibaba,
all information about the seller’s wholesale prices are displayed on
the online platforms. The buyer chooses the sellers by analyzing their
evaluations, locations, and services before making a decision. This
justifies the presence of these efforts in our model along with an
exogenous wholesale price.
– 𝜆𝑅 𝑄 𝑐𝑇 is the total amount of transaction cost paid by the retailer
within the online platform that the firms are using. Note that we assume
that the marginal transaction cost, 𝑐𝑇 , is the same for the two firms.
In the -game, both firms are profit maximizers and play the game
in a non-cooperative manner.

In this paper, we seek to analyze a simple supply chain (SC) model
with the main goal of evaluating the operational and economic benefits
that SC members can obtain when moving from a traditional platform
to blockchain when making transactions. In this regard, we investigate
an SC that is composed of one supplier, firm 𝑆 (he), and one retailer,
firm 𝑅 (she). The firms negotiate and set their strategies in an online
platform. The supplier is the chain leader and sets a certain amount of
online services, 𝐴, to be delivered. The retailer is the chain follower,
shows a certain willingness to purchase from the supplier and sets
the final price of the products, 𝑝, as well as the number of goods to
purchase, 𝑄. Since the firms work in an online platform, the game
moves according to the following steps:
1. The supplier displays online information about the availability of
goods as well as the selling price, 𝑤, which is assumed to be exogenous.
2. The retailer seeks to purchase from the supplier a certain quantity
𝑄. At the same time, she also decides the optimal selling price, 𝑝, at
which she seeks to sell the goods.
3. The supplier considers the retailer’s strategies and offers a certain
package of online services by investing some efforts, 𝐴.
We assume that the supplier has an infinite production capacity,
works in a make-to-order mode, and is always able to satisfy the
retailer’s requests. The SC can be managed by using two different digital
platforms, either a traditional online marketplace or a blockchain.
We aim to identify the conditions under which the implementation
of a blockchain is operationally and economically convenient. Therefore, we characterize a traditional online marketplace (-game) and
compare it to a blockchain setting (-game).

– 𝑐𝐴 𝐴 ∕2 is the online service investments made by the supplier,
with 𝑐𝐴 reflecting the marginal impact of these efforts in the firm’s
objective function. The particular quadratic form of these efforts supports the concavity assumptions; dividing by half allows the analytical
development to be lighter, while that effect can be later controlled by
using the parameter 𝑐𝐴 (De Giovanni and Zaccour, 2019a).
– 𝑐𝑇 is the marginal transaction cost that the supplier faces according to the quantity moved over the supply chain 𝑄 , as well as the

stakeholders belonging to the SC. Note that 𝜆𝑆 is a scaling parameter

she cannot sell more than 𝛼𝑄 , which represents the shelf availability.

ways of publishing their transactions.1 In this regard, we link the
recognition obtainable through tokens to the main responsibility of
firms. On the one hand, the supplier is responsible to invest the amount
of money that he claims. Therefore, these investments generate tokens
for the supplier’s wallet. On the other hand, the retailer is most likely
responsible for the amount of goods that she sells. Consequently, the

higher is number of transactions through the blockchain, the higher
the number of tokens she receives.
– 𝐹 is the fixed cost that the retailer spends to implement the

since she is the firms subject to the business and has the main motivations for securing the transactions through blockchains. According to
the report by EY (2019), the fix cost for implementing a blockchain do
not depend on the business risks amplitude but rather they link to the
type of blockchain (e.g., private or public) as well as the technology
used.

that consumers prefer to purchase online because they have a high
sensitivity to price and enjoy savings through online channels (Chiang
and Dholakia, 2003). When consumers’ sensitivity to price is low or
negligible, firms do not need to carry out online purchasing activities
and incur purchasing and supply risks. Therefore, the entire online
structure is not fully trustable, secure, and transparent.
We focus our analysis on three key parameters, 𝑐𝑇 , 𝛾, and 𝜙, namely,
transaction inefficiency, whose amplitude influences the firms’ behavior
when playing the -game.

platform, the transaction inefficiency discourages the supplier’s investment

According to Proposition 2, the supplier is highly discouraged by
the presence of transaction costs and risks. In fact, his efforts in online
service constantly decrease with the transaction cost and, consequently,
the number of services guaranteed is low as well. This signifies that the
supplier faces important transaction costs that limit sales development.
In fact, the service efforts have a direct and positive connection with
sales. Therefore, the transaction costs may be a considerable deterrent
for the suppliers’ service efforts. In the same vein, the distortion existing
between services and sales pushes the supplier to reduce the efforts
in service. This is mainly linked to the appreciation that consumers
have of the service package offered when the service comes from
online sources. According to Chiang and Dholakia (2003), consumers
have a different perception of the benefits obtainable from online and
offline services since the online service can present issues like long
delivery time and low online services (Abdul-Muhmin, 2010). This is
even more evident when consumers do not fully trust the firm providing
the services and lower their expectations regarding the real services
to be received. This lack of trust translates into a lower amount that
the supplier invests in services, which deteriorates the sales through
the amplitude of 𝜃. Finally, the supplier knows that the transition
between him and the retailer might be not be secure and that the
related uncertainty discourages the SC business. From his side, the
supplier has no practical tool to assure the SC members regarding
security, volatility, and risks of transactions. Therefore, he knows that
all these uncertainties translate into lower appeal for online business
and expects retailers to be less willing to close transactions or to finalize
a transaction with big orders. Therefore, the supplier sets small efforts
for services due to pessimistic forecasts.

In the -game, the firms adopt a traditional online platform for the
SC negotiations rather than using blockchain. Therefore, their transactions occur through third parties (e.g., banks, financial intermediaries),
implying some marginal transaction costs for both of them. The game
evolves according to the following moves: The supplier announces
that he will be able to deliver goods at a wholesale price, 𝑤, which
is exogenous; the retailer reacts to this announcement by setting the
optimal quantity 𝑄 to be purchased as well as the selling price, 𝑝 ;
the supplier takes this information into consideration and decides the
optimal services efforts to be invested, 𝐴 . The equilibria of the -game

Interestingly, Condition 1 informs that the game feasibility is always

The results in Proposition 5 reveal that the triple 𝑐𝑇 , 𝛾, 𝜙 is highly
detrimental for the SC’s economic performance, whose outcomes fully
depend on the absence of a platform allowing firms to remove the
traditional transaction cost, mitigate the supplier risk, and eliminate
the service risk due to missing transparency of the firms involved and
a missing protocol to verify the legitimacy of transactions as well as
ensure the supplier’s integrity, commitment, and trust. Accordingly, SCs
can significantly enhance their financial outcomes by removing any
(
)
effect of the triple 𝑐𝑇 , 𝛾, 𝜙 , adjusting their behavior accordingly, and
achieving successful sales targets. In the next section, we allow the SC
to achieve these objectives through the implementation of blockchain
applications.

is given in Box II.

Propositions 3 and 4 inform on the negative implications that downstream firms experience when missing any blockchain application. As
with the supplier, the retailer also faces important transaction costs,
which are a function of both the quantity ordered and the supplier’s
service. In the former case, the transaction cost links to any unit of
goods that is moved over the supply chain; in the latter case, the retailer
faces transaction costs to connect her consumers with the supplier. Consequently, the retailer pays a double bill and the overall convenience
of the costly transaction decreases considerably, with negative effects
on the quantity involved. Interestingly, a generally accepted result in
economics is that decreasing quantity (and then demand) leads to a
price increase, which allows the decision maker to balance quantity
and price. Within the framework that we are modeling, we see that the
price follows the same direction as the quantity ordered. In fact, the
retailer knows that the supplier invests fewer efforts in service, with a
negative impact on sales. This negative impact is then counter-balanced
by a price decrease.
Because the supply chain connections and transactions are not
regulated, the supplier faces a high risk of receiving a lower amount
than the real quantity ordered. Abdul-Muhmin (2010) shows that the
supplier risk for non-regulated online purchasing can considerably
influence firms’ performance. This risk makes the retailer more prudent when deciding the quantity orders leading to lower lot sizes
corroborated by an increase of the connections with different suppliers
(suppliers risk diversification). Under such circumstances, the supplier
might want to ensure a high capital turnover by charging a lower price.
Also, the presence of low quantity on the retailer’s shelf reflects into
a lower level of service, exemplified by the product availability. The
low price seeks to also balance the (scarce) goods availability at an
accessible price.
Finally, the service risk that the retailer experiences has a negative
influence on both the quantity and the price. From the retailer’s side,
this effect implies doubts regarding the supplier and the suspicion that
the service efforts will eventually translate in low consumer satisfaction
and, consequently, low sales. This dubious situation drives the retailer
through the decision to invest less in the business by ordering a lower
final quantity. The intention would probably be to get experience in
working with the supplier before diving into more important and involved connections. Since acquiring trust needs time, no formal tool or
standard ensures the correct order finalization. On the other hand, the
retailer charges low prices to balance the overall inefficiency created
by doubtful orders and uncertain investments in service.

4.2. Equilibria in the -game
In the -game, the retailer seeks to carry out the SC affairs on
a blockchain. Therefore, she invests in a new platform that implies
fixed cost, 𝐹 , variable costs linked to the transactions within the
blockchain, 𝑐𝐵 , and the tokens, 𝑣. While the adoption of a blockchain
activates the effect of the triple (𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣), it also nullifies the effect
(
)
of the triple 𝑐𝑇 , 𝛾, 𝜙 . The new triple consists of two cost elements
for the firms, 𝐹 and 𝑐𝐵 , and one positive element, 𝑣. 𝐹 enter into
the retailer’s objective function because she is the only firm investing
in a fixed cost for the blockchain, which is exemplified by hiring IS
developers and experts to implement the blockchain and integrate it
within the current IS as well as the energy cost. In contrast, 𝑐𝐵 and 𝑣
enter into all firms’ profit functions. The former still depends on the
transactions linked to the quantity moved along the supply chain; the
latter represents trust, transparency, commitments, and visibility that
all firms gain, when working through a blockchain. Also, 𝑣 provides
value to all other SC members not taking part in the transactions as
well as all other stakeholders surrounding the business. Finally, the
supply chain transactions occur on the blockchain platforms and the
game evolves according to the following moves: The supplier publishes
in the blockchain that he will be able to deliver goods at a wholesale
price, 𝑤, which is exogenous, fix, and transparent; the retailer reacts
to this announcement by setting the optimal quantity 𝑄 to purchase
as well as the selling price, 𝑝 , whose information is available on
the blockchain; the supplier determines and publishes the amount of
services, 𝐴 , on the blockchain. The equilibria of the  -game are
displayed in the following proposition.

According to Proposition 8, the retailer exploits the benefits of a
blockchain application in several ways. First, as for the supplier, she
fully removes the uncertainty from the transactions, which then become
trustful and transparent. Therefore, she exploits the benefits of no
transactional risks which are exemplified by purchasing more quantity,
displaying more goods on the shelf to achieve the maximum market
potential, and increasing the price at the same time. This dual effect
contrasts with the general economic trade-off between quantity and
pricing. Nevertheless, our findings depend on the brick-and-mortar SC
that we modeled where the quantity on the shelf determines the market
size. Second, making transactions on a blockchain leads to tokens
through which all firms and stakeholders around the retailer acquire
confidence and trust in developing future business and transactions.
This effect is important for balancing the higher level of confidence
and trust with a larger price. When the transactions are secure, the
consumers have better feelings when purchasing and suppliers become
aware of the supply chain visibility in the transactions.
Note that the retailer should compare the positive effect of tokens to
the cost implications. In fact, the blockchain implies both variable costs
for the retailer (e.g., coding, protocol agreement, number of accesses)
and fixed costs (e.g., cost for implementing the blockchain and integrating it within the IS). Increasing the marginal blockchain transaction
cost harms the retailer’s willingness to implement this technology, the
positive implications of removing the risk terms, as well as the overall
convenience of the purchase. In such cases, increasing the price may
be detrimental since the market will not positively perceive the pricing
policy, although it is generated through transparent, fair, and visible
transactions. In addition, the convenience of purchasing a large amount
of goods through a trustful transaction may not be justified by the
related market expansion. Therefore, the negative cost effects induced
by a blockchain may lead to a discrepancy between the goods displayed
on the shelf and the market potential to be achieved.
In principle, the adoption of a blockchain makes consumers more
secure about the transactions carried out by the firms involved in the
goods’ delivery. The absence of supply chain and delivery risks makes
products more available on the shelf, leading consumers to have higher
accessibility and goods availability. Furthermore, the absence of a
service risk makes consumers more comfortable with the entire package
of post-sale services, which increases their confidence in the purchase
and their willingness to purchase more. At the same time, these higher
levels of services imply higher prices for consumers. Therefore, overall,
the implementation of a blockchain does not necessarily lead to a sales
increase. Rather, firms need to balance the higher efforts needed for
adopting this new technology with the potential negative implications
for the demand.

Proof. See Appendix. □
To ensure feasibility, all the strategies request that denominators to
be positive.
Condition 2. 2𝛽𝑐𝑄 − 𝛼 2 > 0 ensures that all strategies for the -game are
positive.
Condition 2 is more restrictive than Condition 1 and informs that
2
𝛽 > 2𝑐𝛼 , meaning that the retailer faces more problems externally
𝑄

with consumers than internally through the entire purchasing process.
The high consumer sensitivity to price indicates that the firms face
high pressures to decrease the price since consumers’ motivations for
purchasing online through a blockchain is mainly due to low online
prices. Condition 2 ensures that the numerator of 𝐴 is always positive
as 𝑤 − 𝑐𝐵 − 𝑐𝑆 > 0 by construction. Otherwise, the supplier has negative
marginal revenues when finalizing transactions through a blockchain.
Finally, we need to ensure positive numerators for 𝑄∗ and 𝑝∗ by

The supplier exploits the blockchain in three ways. First, using
(
)
the blockchain fully removes the triple 𝑐𝑇 , 𝛾, 𝜙 , thus removing all
inefficiency linked to the transaction with the banks as well as the
supply and delivery risks. Second, the supplier invests more in service
when it gains a high amount of tokens, which is exemplified by the
high level of appreciation gained by suppliers, consumers, and stakeholders, who highly trust and believe in the supplier’s actions and
express additional willingness to work together in the future. Third,
the blockchain still generates costs for transactions which are linked
to the transaction volume and size, the consensus protocol, and the
node hosting method. Nevertheless, these are most likely lower than
the transaction cost 𝑐𝑇 and, in case they are higher, companies evaluate
the balance created by 𝑣 and 𝑐𝐵 . The higher service efforts inspired by
the use of a blockchain generate an increase in demand, suggesting for
an overall reconsideration of the supplier’s strategies and behavior.

The adoption of a blockchain brings positive and negative news
for firms. On the one hand, the blockchain fully removes the risk
in purchasing and service, leading to high transparency on the real
transactions occurring over the supply chain and mutual enhancement
of trust. The latter can be quantified through an option value (tokens),
which represents the future benefits that the companies will acquire
after managing their business through the blockchain. For example,
firms and stakeholders will know on the true quantity that has been
moved in transactions, the real amount of investments in services,
and the market prices for the goods exchanged. On the other hand,
the blockchain carries some fixed costs due to its implementation and
integration with the current IS. Furthermore, it still implies transaction
costs that link to consensus protocols, transaction size and volume,
cloud costs, and node hosting. All these trade-offs can make the adoption of a blockchain economically inconvenient and raise the questions
regarding the extent to which this technology really works. Clearly,
in the particular case when 𝑐𝐵 = 0, the firms’ strategies and sales
(
)
increase considerably. Therefore, the analysis of the triple 𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣
informs on the real economic convenience of adopting a blockchain.
We numerically analyze the effect of this triple in the next section due
to the highly involved network of relationships among all parameter
values.

)

references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
this article.)

a direct impact on sales, the blockchain efficiency, most likely deter(
)
mined by the couple 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 , determines the success of implementing
a blockchain and incentivizes firms to use blockchains even more to
develop their business. Note that the blue plan, which refers to 𝐴 ,
moves up (down) according to decreasing (increasing) values for the
triple (𝜙, 𝛾, 𝑐𝑇 ) (see Proposition 2). Therefore, the supplier finds further
strategic incentive for investing more in service when the blockchain
marginal costs are low and the triple (𝜙, 𝛾, 𝑐𝑇 ) takes high values. Note
that when 𝑣 = 0, the supplier still finds the blockchain strategic because
it removes both delivery and service risks. Instead, when 𝑐𝐵 is high,
the supplier is discouraged from investing more in service, even with
very high 𝑣. Hence, the marginal blockchain costs 𝑐𝐵 really determine
the supplier’s strategic behavior. More in general, for a given triple
(𝜙, 𝛾, 𝑐𝑇 ), we define the efficient blockchain frontier as the set 𝛺 that
(
)
contains all pairs 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 , which results in 𝐴 = 𝐴 . Therefore, 𝛺
{
}
{
}
= 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝐴 > 𝐴 and 𝛺 = 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝐴 < 𝐴 .

5. Comparison between the -game and -game
To appreciate the benefits of a blockchain, we carry out a numerical analysis on the key parameters. The two games differ along six
parameters, specifically, 𝛾, 𝜙, 𝑐𝑇 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝐹 , and 𝑣, with 𝛾 and 𝜙 describing
some stochastic components and, consequently, the retailer’s risks for
purchasing and service. To properly compare the solutions and derive
managerial insights, we fix the parameter values for 𝛾 = 0.01, 𝜙 =
0.01, and 𝑐𝑇 = 0.05, whose effects have been checked analytically in
Section 3. We then focus on the remaining three parameters: 𝑣, 𝑐𝐵 , and
𝐹 . In addition, the other parameters have been fixed as follows: 𝛼 = 0.9,
𝛽 = 1, 𝜃 = 1, 𝜔 = 0.8, 𝑐𝑆 = 0.02, 𝑐𝑅 = 0.02, 𝑐𝐴 = 0.05, 𝑐𝑄 = 0.05,
𝜆𝑆 = 0.01, and 𝜆𝑅 = 0.01. To fix these parameters, we referred to
real estimations linked to business reports (e.g., EY, 2019), secondary
information available (Azati, 2019), empirical estimations reported in
the literature (e.g., van Hoek, 2019; Hackius and Petersen, 2017) as
well as the parameter estimations from the literature of game theory
(e.g., Genc and De Giovanni, 2020). By fixing these parameters, we
ensure that all conditions that we have previously introduced are met
and that both games are feasible.

5.2. Quantity, price and sales
Fig. 2 shows the behavior of the retailer’s order quantity and price,
as well as the sales that she obtains. Although these three are measured
in different scales (vertical dimension), the comparison over the two
games shows equivalent shapes. The main difference with respect to
Fig. 1 is on the amplitude of the -game outcomes over the -game
outcomes. Accordingly, the retailer gains more confidence than the
supplier when implementing a blockchain, which translates into higher
purchasing quantity. Intuitively, this quantity is positively (negatively)
influenced by token 𝑣 (marginal blockchain cost 𝑐𝐵 ). The high trust and
confidence that the retailer obtains through the blockchain have immediate links and benefits for sales, as all business risks are effectively
removed from the decision-making process. In addition, the retailer
enjoys the absence of transaction costs linked to the use of traditional
online platforms. Although the adoption of blockchains removes several
inefficiencies linked to a traditional supply chain and transactions, the
inefficient installation and management of blockchains can limit the
firms’ willingness to adopt this type of project. The existence of fixed
and variable costs deriving from blockchain applications makes the
benefits very small. In fact, the traditional transaction cost might simply
be substituted by the blockchain cost, with the result that the project
could appear marginally appealing. While the risk mitigation is a clear
advantage, the existence of additional blockchain costs means that
retailers charge higher prices, with the result that the products become
less appealing to consumers. As a consequence, retailers purchase less
quantity, demonstrating that the business is marginally worthy. This
perception becomes a real issue for the supplier, who invests less in

5.1. Service strategies
We first compare the service strategies for the two games in Fig. 1.
The graphical findings corroborate the results in Proposition 7 and
provide additional information: 𝐴 increases in 𝑣 at a smaller rate than
a decrease in 𝑐𝐵 . Hence, firms should assign a higher importance to
the blockchain variable costs than to the marginal values generated
through tokens, 𝑣. Put differently, the blockchain costs matter more
than the blockchain token generation. When the latter (the marginal
blockchain cost) is high, the supplier has more (less) motivation for
investing in service, being that the transactions behind the use of a
blockchain are highly appealing (discouraging). Since the service has

e. 𝛩# corresponds to the case in which both firms are economically worse off with the implementation of a blockchain. As mentioned earlier, this result is mainly driven by the presence of variable
costs generated by managing transactions within the blockchain that,
although they mitigate the traditional transaction costs, imply new variable costs on the consensus protocol, the data size, and volumes, and
the protection of transactions that make the blockchain economically
unappealing.
3. Contrary to the findings that we obtained for the strategies, the
(
)
firms’ profits are more sensitive to the couple 𝑣, 𝑐𝐵 . That is, while
the firms’ strategies mainly change with respect to 𝑐𝐵 , the token value
𝑣 also makes a contribution to the final decision on the adoption of a
blockchain. Therefore, the strategic behavior of firms working in a digital environment is only marginally dictated by the token implied by the
digital transformation. However, the final evaluation of the blockchain
application is most likely economically driven, being that the firms
(
)
are profit-maximizers. Thus, the couple 𝑣, 𝑐𝐵 yields higher monetary
value and acquires great attention by firms. However, 𝑐𝐵 gives a
sufficient condition for implementing a blockchain. For example, when
𝑐𝐵 = 0, both firms have high operational and economic motivations for
implementing a blockchain, independent of the amplitude of the token,
𝑣. In contrast, when 𝑣 = 0, the amplitude of 𝑐𝐵 determines the firms’
willingness to pursue such a project.

service leading to a deterioration of the overall sales. Finally, 𝛺′ ⊂ 𝛺
represents the blockchain efficient frontier that makes the retailers’
strategies and sales indifferent when choosing to work with traditional
′
online platforms or pursue blockchain applications. Accordingly, 𝛺 =
{
}
{
}
𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝑝 > 𝑝 , 𝑄 > 𝑄 , and 𝐷 > 𝐷 ; similarly, 𝛺′ = 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶
′

𝑝 < 𝑝 , 𝑄 < 𝑄 , and 𝐷 < 𝐷 . Interestingly, 𝛺# = 𝛺 ∩ 𝛺 inside
which firms have divergent behavior with the implementation of a
{
}
blockchain; specifically, 𝛺# = 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝑝 > 𝑝 , 𝑄 > 𝑄 , 𝐴 < 𝐴 ,
and 𝐷 > 𝐷 . This is due to the power that the supplier has over the SC
by playing the role of leader. Therefore, he knows that the retailer is the
most interested firm in implementing a blockchain since she will gain
two effects: Reduction in the delivery and service risks and mitigation
of transaction costs. In contrast, the supplier will only enjoy the latter
effect. Consequently, the supplier pushes the retailer to do more when
a blockchain is implemented.

6. Stochastic components 𝜸 and 𝝓
The analysis that we carried out in Section 5 allowed us to identify the regions inside which the adoption of blockchain technologies
makes firms economically better off. So far, we treated the stochastic
components 𝛾 and 𝜙 as exogenous to focus the investigation on the
business parameters that have the most relevant impact on the firms’
decisions while considering the risks associated to the supply and the
demand as given. That is, so far we assumed that firms have a belief
on the stochastic components and use that information to set the best
strategies and maximize their profits. Hereby, we adopt a different
approach by considering 𝛾 and 𝜙 as random variables that distribute
according to a uniform distribution.
(
)
To focus on the stochastic components, we work inside the 𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣
−𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒 in which the firms’ decisions are borderline between implementing or disregarding the implementation of a blockchain. Specifically, we
fix 𝐹 = 0.5, 𝑐𝐵 = 0.12, and 𝑣 = 0.1. By doing so, we can really appreciate
the impact of the stochastic components in the decision making process.
Put differently, in the region corresponding to the triple 𝐹 = 0, 𝑐𝐵 = 0,
and 𝑣 = 0.2, the impact of the stochastic components will not help
firms in improving their decision-making process because the adoption
of blockchain technology will be convenient. Hence, the values of the
stochastic components will never revert the findings. Similarly, in the
region corresponding to the triple 𝐹 = 1, 𝑐𝐵 = 0.15, and 𝑣 = 0, firms
have no interest for blockchains. Therefore, the stochastic components,
which basically have detrimental impact on the business, will never
revert the firms’ preferences as well.

5.3. Profits
Fig. 3 displays the supplier’s profits on the left-hand side (LHS) and
the retailer’s profits on the right-hand side (RHS). The figure confirms
the insights that have been derived from the analysis of strategies and
sales. Therefore, we can offer the following additional intuitions:
1. The fixed cost required for implementing and integrating the
blockchain within the current online platforms and ERP only has a
marginal impact on firm profits. On the one hand, the supplier’s profits
are not at all influenced by the implementation cost due to the missing
interfaces with strategies. On the other hand, the retailer’s profit is
– clearly – negatively influenced by such investments. Nevertheless,
the negative impact on the retailer’s economic outcomes is most likely
negligible. This implies that the investment in blockchains does not
represent at all a limit since the firms’ strategies can be adjusted to
take the invested amount into consideration.
2. The surface identifying the cases in which the supplier is economically better off corresponds to all cases in which the adoption of
a blockchain leads to a profit-Pareto-improving situation. Accordingly,
we can identify the following regions:
a. 𝛩 is the frontier for the retailer that identifies the triples
(
)
𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 informing on the indifferent combinations of these three

}
{
}
parameters. Therefore, 𝛩 = 𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝛱𝑅 > 𝛱𝑅 and 𝛩 = 𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶
𝛱𝑅 < 𝛱𝑅 .
b. 𝛩′ is the frontier for the supplier that identifies the triples
(
)
𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 informing on the indifferent combinations of these three

parameters, e.g., 𝛱𝑆 = 𝛱𝑆 . Therefore, 𝛩 = 𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝛱𝑆 > 𝛱𝑆
{
}
and 𝛩′ = 𝐹 , 𝑐𝐵 , 𝑣 ∶ 𝛱𝑆 < 𝛱𝑆 .

6.1. Analysis of the delivery risk, 𝛾
The delivery risk, 𝛾, profoundly modifies the firms’ preferences for
the implementation of blockchain technology.
Fig. 4a shows the supplier’s profits in various settings when varying
𝛾. Note the profits 𝛱𝑆 described by a red line are the only ones being a
function of 𝛾. The green line refers to the supplier’s profits 𝛱𝑆 = 3.451,
which is independent of 𝛾. The other three lines are drawn considering

𝛾 as a random variable uniformly distributed, 𝑈 ∼ [0, ̂
𝛾 ]. Therefore, we
simulate three random distributions describing three potential states,
in which the delivery risk can be either low (̂
𝛾 = 0.01), or medium
(
)
(
)
̂
𝛾 = 0.05 , or high ̂
𝛾 = 0.1 . This allow us to analyze how different
realizations and uncertainty levels can influence the results and allow
us to leave the following comments:
1. The comparison of 𝛱𝑆 and 𝛱𝑆 informs that low delivery risks
suggest not to implement the blockchain. This finding remains valid
also when ̂
𝛾 = 0.01. The gray line in Fig. 4 has been derived by
generating a set of data using 𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.01] and simulating a thousand distributions. The simulated distribution has 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ] = 5.23. As
illustrated in Fig. 4a, the related distribution is always above 𝛱𝑆 ,
indicating that the supplier finds the implementation of blockchain
not economically worth. We have also checked this result empirically
by using the statistical tests available in Mathematica to check the
difference between 𝛱𝑆 and 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.01]. For all simulations
that we run we find that 𝛱𝑆 and 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ] are statistically different with
𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05 and always results that 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.01] > 𝛱𝑆 .
2. We fix medium level for the delivery risk, e.g., ̂
𝛾 = 0.05, and
generated a set of data using 𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.05]. The path of the related
profits is displayed in yellow in Fig. 4a and informs of an increasing
uncertainty that moves around 𝛱𝑆 with 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.05] = 3.18. We
have used the statistical tests available in Mathematica and verified that
𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.05] = 𝛱𝑆 with 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 > 0.05 in 71% of our simulations.
Consequently, the presence of medium delivery risk, e.g., ̂
𝛾 = 0.05, does

not justify the implementation of a blockchain since the supplier will
have a probability of (only) 29% to get a significant increase in profits.
3. When the delivery risk is highly uncertain and distributes through
the distribution 𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.1], the delivery risk substantially harms the
supplier’s business resulting 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.1] < 𝛱𝑆 for all simulated
cases. As it results from Fig. 4, the profits 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.1] (blue line)
are below 𝛱𝑆 in most of the cases and show considerable spikes that
exemplify the high volatility existing in this scenario. Note that the
realizations of ̂
𝛾 leading to 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.1] > 𝛱𝑆 result to be nonsignificant in 94% of the simulations. Therefore, high volatile delivery
suggests the adoption of blockchain technology.
We carried out a similar analysis for the retailer, whose results
are shown in Fig. 4b. The green line refers to the retailer’s profits
𝛱𝑅 = 27.541 while the red line refers to 𝛱𝑅 , which is decreasing in
𝛾. As previously, the other three lines link to 𝛾 as a random variable
uniformly distributed, 𝑈 ∼ [0, ̂
𝛾 ], with the same realizations obtained
for the supplier. Accordingly, the following comments can be left:
1. 𝛱𝑅 > 𝛱𝑅 when the delivery risks is known and the entire delivery process is secure and well managed, e.g., 𝛾 < 0.02. Furthermore,
𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.01] > 𝛱𝑅 always holds since the random error distributed
as 𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.01] generates a level of variability that the system always
tolerates. This implies 𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.01] = 36.37 which is always higher
than 𝛱𝑅 . This is confirmed by our simulations results, all resulting in
a 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05. Accordingly, as for the supplier, the presence of
10

delivery risk. In fact, traditional online platforms are able to absorb the
business volatility linked to services in most of the cases. Our simulations show that both firms have an economic incentive to implement a
blockchain only when 𝜙̂ > 0.25, resulting 𝐸[𝛱𝑖 ∣ 𝜙̂ = 0.25] < 𝛱𝑖 with
𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05 and 𝑖 = 𝑆, 𝑅.

a low delivery risk suggests for not pursuing the implementation of a
blockchain.
2. When the delivery risk takes values according to the stochastic
distribution 𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.05], it results that 𝛱𝑅 = 𝛱𝑅 in 83% of our
simulation results, statistically supported by 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 > 0.05 (yellow
line in Fig. 4b). In these cases, the probability that a blockchain grants
sufficient economic advantages is very marginal, suggesting that a
supply chain managed through a traditional online system is able to
absorb the medium levels of delivery risks even without the adoption
of blockchain technologies.
3. High delivery risks distributed through 𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.1] always call
for the adoption of blockchain as 𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.1] = 12.63 < 𝛱𝑅 is
always statistically supported with 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05. Fig. 4b describes
the behavior of the retailer’s profits under this scenario and shows that
𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣ ̂
𝛾 = 0.1] < 𝛱𝑅 in most of the cases: Our statistical tests
confirm this result in 98% of the cases, suggesting that the adoption
of blockchains entails a profit-improving effect with high probability.
To summarize, the analysis of the stochastic delivery risk shows a
direct connection between 𝛾 and the decision of adopting blockchains.
High (low) volatility of deliveries suggest to adopt (disregard)
blockchain technology, while the presence of medium delivery risk
creates several economic doubts. In fact, traditional online platforms
can still absorb medium levels of delivery risks and ensure an effective
management of transactions without the use of blockchains.

7. Smart contracts in blockchains
In this section, we explore two options available for the SC to
pursue a blockchain project while allowing some contract terms to be
automatically adjusted by a Virtual Machine or/and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) (De Giovanni, 2019a). Smart contracts, which use ethereum
for a proper implementation, allow self-executing scripts that reside
on the blockchain, leading to an integration of these concepts within
the SC negotiations and allowing for proper, distributed, and heavily automated workflows (Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016). Raskin
(2017) defines a smart contract as an agreement wherein execution
is automated by a computer that ensures performance and execution
without recourse to the courts and mitigating any human discretion.
Therefore, a smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of
a contract (Szabo, 1994). Proponents of smart contracts claim that
many kinds of contractual clauses may be made partially or fully selfexecuting, self-enforcing, or both (Brown, 2015), and can be based on
both forward and reverse activities (De Giovanni and Zaccour, 2019b).
Considering the framework under investigation we propose two smart
contracts: a smart wholesale price contract and a smart revenue sharing
contract. To activate these two contracts, blockchain technology needs
to be connected to the eco-system by using oracles. These are drivers
that allow firms to move from the physical world to the digital world
and solve off-line operational issues like the first mile and the last
mile. The oracles can be of several types: Hardware oracles (data from
physical world), software oracles (data from online world), human
oracles (consensus for data validation), inbound oracles (external data
as input for the smart contract), and outbound oracles (smart contract
as an input for the external world). The oracles take information from
the physical world, create and adjust incentives for every undertaken
action, and distribute tokens and/or cryptocurrencies through the smart
contracts and according to the information exchange.

6.2. Analysis of the service risk, 𝜙
Compared to the delivery risk, the service risk, 𝜙, has a lower impact
on the firms’ choices of adopting a blockchain. We report the analysis
of the firms’ profits in Fig. 5.
Note the firms profits 𝛱𝑆 and 𝛱𝑅 are described by a red line
and both decrease in 𝜙, while the green lines corresponds to 𝛱𝑆 and
𝛱𝑅 , which are independent of 𝜙. The other lines reflect the firms’
profits that were obtained by simulating the uniformly distributed,
̂
̂
𝑈
( ∼ [0, 𝜙],) where the(service )risk can take low (𝜙 = 0.01), or medium
𝜙̂ = 0.05 , or high 𝜙̂ = 0.1 values. This analysis informs on how
different realizations and uncertainty levels linked to 𝜙 influence the
firms’ preferences in the implementation of blockchains. Accordingly,
we can observe that:
1. The supplier should evaluate the adoption of blockchain only
when the service risk is very high. Our analysis informs that 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣
𝜙̂ = 0.01] = 4.81 > 𝛱𝑆 in all simulations, with 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05;
therefore, the supplier never implements the blockchain when the
consumer risk is low because there is a significant statistical evidence
that the suppliers’ profits would be always penalized by adopting the
technology. Similarly, 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ 𝜙̂ = 0.05] = 4.39 > 𝛱𝑆 in all simulations
with 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 > 0.05; hence, implementing blockchain technology
does not supply any significant economic improvement. Finally, when
𝑈 ∼ [0, 0.1], the supplier has certain probability to improve the profits
as the difference between 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ∣ 𝜙̂ = 0.05] = 3.86 and 𝛱𝑆 would
not be statistically different from zero in 34% of the case. Therefore,
the supplier can improve the profits through the implementation of
blockchain technology with 66% probability of success.
2. As the supplier, also the retailer finds the service risk less detrimental than the delivery risk. We obtain that 𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣ 𝜙̂ = 0.01] =
32.66 > 𝛱𝑅 in all simulations, with 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05; therefore, the
retailer considers the implementation of a blockchain as not economically convenient for low consumer risk, e.g., 𝜙̂ = 0.01. Also, 𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣
𝜙̂ = 0.05] = 29.67 > 𝛱𝑅 in all simulations with 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 > 0.05;
hence, the retailer does not obtain any statistically significant profit
improvement through blockchain when 𝜙̂ = 0.05. Finally, it results
̇ 𝑆 in 57% of the cases that we
that 𝐸[𝛱𝑅 ∣ 𝜙̂ = 0.1] = 20.14>𝛱
explored. Consequently, the service risk affects the retailer’s profits only
marginally, while it has significant effect only for very high levels.
To summarize, the analysis of 𝐸[𝛱𝑆 ] informs that both firms have
lower troubles when facing the service risk than when managing the

7.1. A smart wholesale price contract
When the blockchain can carry out smart wholesale price contracts,
the AI determines the best wholesale price to finalize the transactions.
Within our framework, this signifies that the wholesale price, 𝑤, is no
longer a fixed contractual term but rather varies according to the AI
algorithms and protocols developed in the blockchain. As mentioned
for the -game, the retailer is the main initiator of a blockchain technology because her business is considerably affected by the transaction
inefficiency and business risks. Therefore, the retailer should work with
blockchain developers to define a protocol that allows the Blockchain
̃ to allow the supplier to close
to determine a new wholesale price, 𝑤,
the negotiations on blockchains rather than on online platforms. Hence,
̃ represents an economic incentive that the supplier receives if he
𝑤
agrees to adopt a blockchain with a smart wholesale price. To do so, the
retailer must guarantee that the AI protocol determines the wholesale

price such that 𝑤

supplier expects the wholesale price to be set in a way that he gains at
least the same profits as in the -game. Finally, the AI should search

as by the variable cost linked to the amount of data exchanged within

blockchain that smartly identifies the contractual terms (and in particular the sharing parameter) through which the digital transformation
can represent a convenient step for all SC members. Therefore, we
complement the existing contract with a smart RSC, requiring firms

Proof. See Appendix. □

This section investigates the option of adopting a smart Revenue
Sharing contract (RSC) in the SC. The idea behind the creation of an
ad-hoc contract comes from the inefficiency that the adoption of a
blockchain leaves, which is exemplified by the cost for implementing
and integrating its functionalities within the IS that firms use as well

Interestingly, the implementation of a smart RSC is the only scenario in which the supplier’s service efforts are also influenced by the
retailer’s price. Therefore, the analytical solution on 𝐴 is much more
involved than in other scenarios. However, compared to the  -game,
the solution gives new insights only with the respect to the sharing
parameter 𝜎, which we display in Fig. 7.

Proposition 14. When using a blockchain with a smart RSC, the retailer
purchases higher quantity, charges higher prices, and sells more units when
𝜎 ∈ 𝛴(0, 𝜎].

𝜕𝜎
When proposing a smart RSC, the retailer becomes very proactive
in the SC business development through digital transformation tools.
The use of blockchains complemented with smart RSCs makes the sales
the driver of success. On the one hand, the retailer needs to boost the
sales to recover a part of his revenues that will go to the supplier. On
the other hand, increasing the sales allows the retailer to provide high
levels of incentives to the supplier to increase the service efforts. In fact,
different from the other scenarios, the supplier’s profits also depend on
sales; therefore, he has a certain interest in increasing sales as much
as possible. In contrast, in the other scenarios, the supplier’s profits
depend only on the quantity sold to the retailer. The higher level of
responsibility, involvement, and commitment of the supplier translates
into higher chances to increase the firm’s economic outcomes.
Note that the business opportunities offered through a smart RSC developed and proposed by blockchain applications leaves the consumers
worse off from an economic point of view. As displayed in Proposition 14, the retailer charges higher prices when a smart RSC is in place,
leading several consumers to turn away. However, the higher price does
not translate into lower sales. This is due to the higher quantity that the
retailer puts in the market, which increases the availability of the goods
to a wider population. Therefore, a compensating effect exists between
quantity availability and service with the pricing strategy that goes in
favor of increasing overall sales under a smart RSC in blockchains.

Fig. 7. Service efforts, 𝐴 , and sharing parameter, 𝜎.

Different from all other scenarios, the supplier’s service efforts are
highly dictated by the amplitude of the sharing parameter suggested
by the smart contract. Interestingly, we can see that a discontinuity
point exists around 𝜎 = 0.05, meaning that the retailer shares 5% of
her revenues with the supplier. Clearly, the suppliers efforts increase
proportionally to the sharing parameter lower than 5%, resulting in
𝜕𝐴
> 0 ⟺ 𝜎(0, 𝜎], with 𝜎 = 0.05. After the threshold 𝜎, the
𝜕𝜎
smart contract requires too many efforts from the supplier’s side, whose
service efforts become non-feasible (e.g., the supplier invests a negative
quantity to push the retailer to abandon the idea of using the smart
RSC). Therefore, we can formulate the following claim:
Claim 1. The smart RSC incentivizes the supplier to invest more in service.
However, overly high incentives require a large service investment that the
supplier may not be able to afford.

Proposition 15. When using a blockchain with a smart RSC, the SC
members’ profits increase in the sharing parameter when 𝜎 ∈ 𝛴(0, 𝜎]. In
comparison to the profits in the -game, three cases are possible:
1. 𝜎 ∈ (0, 𝜎𝑅 ]; therefore, 𝛱𝑆 < 𝛱𝑆 and 𝛱𝑅 ≤ 𝛱𝑅 ;

Note that for 𝜎 > 0.2 the service efforts become positive again.
Nevertheless, they lead to losses for the supplier, suggesting that the
only way for a smart RSC to grant economic advantages to the whole
SC is to set up a share 𝜎 ∶ 𝜎 ∈ 𝛴(0, 𝜎].

2. 𝜎 ∈ (𝜎𝑅 , 𝜎𝑆 ]; therefore, 𝛱𝑆 ≤ 𝛱𝑆 and 𝛱𝑅 > 𝛱𝑅 ;
3. 𝜎 ∈ (𝜎𝑆 , 𝜎]; therefore, 𝛱𝑆 > 𝛱𝑆 and 𝛱𝑅 > 𝛱𝑅 .
The findings in Proposition 13, which are also summarized in Fig. 8,
can be explained as follows:
1. The blockchain will never propose a smart RSC with a sharing
parameter lower than 𝜎𝑅 . In fact, the region of sharing parameter
𝜎 ∈ (0, 𝜎𝑅 ] identifies the space inside which none of the SC members
benefits from the adoption of a blockchain complemented with a smart
RSC. This insight signals to SC members that, for non-digital SC applications, the use of sharing agreements can results in a worst-case

Proposition 13. When using a blockchain with a smart RSC, the supplier
invests more in service when 𝜎 ∈ 𝛴(0, 𝜎].
The sharing parameter region 𝛴 that ensures higher investments in
service also guarantees that the supplier’s strategy is positive. Therefore, it becomes a necessary condition for optimality, which ensures
positivity of the other strategies, sales, and profits.

option when the negotiation ends without a proper arrangement of the
financial flows. At the same time, this finding informs that firms seeking
to implement this type of digital blockchain configuration should be
ready to share a bit more revenues than firms in classical business.
2. When the blockchain is fully managed by the retailer and the
intent is to optimize only the retailer’s profits, the smart RSC will
suggest offering 𝜎 ∈ (𝜎𝑅 , 𝜎𝑆 ]. This solution may be a bit risky for the
retailer because the supplier is in a worse situation than a traditional
online business. Hence, the supplier can decide not to accept the
contract if other options are available in the market. Consequently,
retailers are advised to undertake a blockchain with a smart RSC and
propose 𝜎 ∈ (𝜎𝑅 , 𝜎𝑆 ] only when the supplier does not have alternative
retailers to work with, resulting in a weaker market position.
3. When the smart RSC suggests to offering a 𝜎 ∈ (𝜎𝑆 , 𝜎], both firms
are in a better off negotiation and achieve a profit-Pareto-improving
situation. In this case, it is in the best interest of both firms to have a
blockchain algorithm that suggests to the retailer offering the maximum
sharing parameter, 𝜎; in such a case, the supplier gets a large portion of
the retailer’s profits and then has considerable incentive to invest the
highest possible amount in service. From her side, the retailer purchases
the maximum possible quantity from the supplier and charges the
highest possible price to extract as much economic value as possible
from the market. Overall, the smart RSC makes the SC highly efficient
and profitable when 𝜎 ∈ (𝜎𝑆 , 𝜎]. In particular, the retailer allows the
blockchain to smartly change the sharing parameter and offering a
share of 2.5% to make the supplier indifferent between negotiating in
blockchains or in traditional online platforms.

cost for energy to run the blockchains, cost for the blockchain usage,
and cost for the time spent waiting for the block change consensus.
Therefore, managers can properly assess the real benefits of blockchains
only when a correct comparison between the cost savings from traditional transactions and the business risk mitigation generate more value
than the blockchain implementation and management. Furthermore,
managers should also spend some time to quantify the tokens granted
by a blockchain. This is exemplified by, for example, the trust that
the firm gains within the SC, the knowledge of the other companies’
behavior and performance, the visibility of all operations, and the
warranty to always perform to consumers’ expectations. These (soft)
features gained through a blockchain are not immediately quantifiable;
however, managers should assign a value to the single knowledge
creation piece acquired through the use of the blockchain to properly
evaluate its implementation.
3. Beyond transaction costs and investments, managers should carefully evaluate the impact of business risks on their economic performance. The service risks have a marginal impact on the decision to
implement a blockchain. This is most likely linked to the information
flows that consumers generate through online systems, social networks,
and sharing platforms, which allow firms to update their strategies
accordingly. Differently, the delivery risks are more dangerous for SC
management; therefore, managers should properly map all business
risks associated to the delivery process and setup a blockchain system
that considers and optimizes all of them.
4. The ‘‘pure’’ adoption of a blockchain cannot be very appealing,
especially from an economic point of view. That is, investing in a
blockchain only to gain transparency, visibility, and security while
getting rid of transaction costs and business risks may not be sufficient
to justify the implementation of blockchain technology. In such circumstances, we suggest that managers look at smart contract parameters
to be modified autonomously by the Blockchain. One of the most
interesting parameters that blockchains can modify in our setting is
the wholesale price. Therefore, once the blockchain becomes operative,
the wholesale price is determined by the AI rather than be predefined.
Clearly, the blockchain is able to generate the wholesale price variation
that is needed to increase firms’ willingness to use Blockchains. For example, the retailer should give a higher wholesale price to the supplier
. Specifically, a 25% increment in the wholesale price leads the supplier
to be willing to use blockchains while granting an 18% increase in
the retailer’s profits. Hence, using a smart wholesale price gives a true
chance to gain all benefits linked to blockchain technologies.
5. Although the smart wholesale price works well to make the
blockchain function, the wholesale price increase can be considered
as to be too high and retailers can be reluctantly to move forward
with blockchains. Thus, we suggest that managers complement the
blockchain technology with a smart RSC. In such a case, the AI of
the blockchain determines the fraction of the retailer’s revenues to be
transferred to the supplier to make it willing to use the new digital
platform. Our results indicate that a share of 2.5% already gives sufficient economic incentive to the supplier to use the blockchain, while
generating a 110% increase in the supplier’s profit. Differently from the
smart wholesale price, the smart RSC makes the supplier responsible

8. Managerial insights
This section offers managerial insights, which can help managers
better evaluate whether to pursue a project based on blockchain technologies. The managerial insights can be summarized in four main
points, as detailed below:
1. Managers should look at investments in blockchain technologies
when the transaction costs over the SC are high and when the related
business risks are high as well. Among all constellations of business
risks that exist in nature, we focus on two: The delivery risks and
the service risks. Both have a negative impact on firms’ business and
the whole SC efficiency. Therefore, when one of those features takes
a high value, firms should evaluate the implementation, integration,
and use of blockchains along with their current IS. Firms can expect
both operational advantages and economic gains. The operational improvements link to: (a) better consumer service and, hence, level of
service, (b) increasing the competitive position through a wider market
offer and increasing sales (with market share implications as well),
and (c) the possibility to charge higher final prices and, consequently,
extract more economic value from the market. The pricing strategy does
not discourage consumers from purchasing thanks to the compensating
effect of better services and market presence.
2. Managers should be aware that blockchains are not free. They
carry costs for installing and integrating them in firms’ current IS.
There are also additional marginal (variable) costs to consider, such as

in the retailer’s revenue achievement and is more adequate when the
blockchain efficiency and business risks have considerable impact on
the SC affairs.

in the decision-making process. Therefore, SCs should compare the
transaction costs and the business risks of a traditional online platform
with the variable blockchain cost. The firms’ strategies and policies can
always be set to overcome the limits of the initial investments, while
the number of tokens alone is not sufficient to justify the adoption of
a blockchain. Furthermore, the transaction costs and the business risks
of traditional platforms have a considerable impact on the blockchain’s
economic advantages. Specifically, when the transaction costs and/or
the business risks are negligible, the adoption of blockchains is operationally inefficient and economically not appealing. Our simulations
demonstrate that the delivery risks have more prominent effects than
service risks. The latter can be mitigated by a traditional online platform in most of the cases, being detrimental only for volatility higher
than 20%. In contrast, the delivery risk has considerable effect on both
firms profits. Delivery risk of 10% suggests to implement blockchain
technology. We demonstrate that the blockchain should request a smart
wholesale price to overcome these limitations. In particular, the retailer
can offer a (minimum) wholesale price increase of 25% to improve its
profits of 18% while allowing the supplier to gain the same amount of
money as in an online platform. Therefore, the smart wholesale price
allows the SC to achieve a profit-Pareto-improving situation and make
the blockchain successful.
Although the smart wholesale price can be a good incentive for
suppliers to work and finalize transactions on a blockchain, having the
retailer offering a 25% wholesale price increase may imply huge investments for her side. This insight leaves rooms to complement blockchain
applications with a smart RSC. Based on the previous statements, the
blockchain alone is not always convenient even if it generates a smart
contract based on a classical wholesale price mechanism. Therefore,
we evaluate the existence of an AI supporting the blockchain that
adds new features to the negotiations and that proposes a smart RSC.
In contrast to the smart wholesale price, which is a pure monetary
incentive based on the quantity that the retailer orders, the smart RSC
incentivizes the supplier in two ways: First, it proposes a share of
the retailer’s revenues coming on top of its profits; second, the smart
RSC makes the supplier responsible for the retailer’s revenue growth
by acting through the services. Our analysis demonstrates that the
supplier can offer a minimum 2.5% share to increase its profits of
110%, while ensuring to the supplier a profit as in an online platform.
Therefore, blockchain technologies complemented with smart RSC are
more successful than both traditional online platforms and blockchains
based on smart wholesale contracts.
Our analysis depends on several simplifying assumptions that lead
to some limitations. First, we characterize a game on a brick-andmortar SC. Other configuration types can be developed to investigate

9. Conclusions
This paper investigates the operational and economic advantages
that firms in a supply chain (SC) can obtain when managing their
businesses through a blockchain rather than using traditional online
platforms. We analyze a simple brick-and-mortar SC composed of one
supplier and one retailer. The use of a traditional online platform
carries both transaction costs and business risks. The former is linked to
the management of global SC connections, requiring several intermediaries, governmental constraints, and cultural differences. The latter
refer to the supply and delivery risks, which are not manageable by
SC members, as well as by the service risks, linked to the real services
provided by global suppliers differing from the original expectations.
These weaknesses can lead the traditional online platforms to inefficient negotiations and risky businesses. All SC members adjust their
strategic behavior accordingly: The supplier invests the lowest possible
efforts in services, which may find very low appreciation by partners
and consumers, especially in a global context; also, the retailer orders
smaller quantity batches and sets lower prices since the overall business
is strategically unappealing and highly risky.
SCs can effectively overcome these negative issues through the
implementation of a blockchain application. The blockchain has several
good features (see Cole et al. (2019) for a comprehensive analysis),
among which the information visibility, transparency, and security
allow both the transaction costs and the supply and service risks to
be fully mitigated. As with all Industry 4.0 technologies and digital
transformation projects, blockchains imply undoubted drawbacks. In
the particular SC framework that we model, SCs seeking to implement
blockchains face fixed costs (e.g., investments for hiring IS experts) as
well as variable costs (e.g., time and energy consumed when running
complex blockchain networks). Hence, firms and SCs need to evaluate the negative implications of traditional online platforms with the
blockchain inefficiency, along with the possible tokens and option value
that the blockchain may imply. The latter refers to the gains in terms
of trust, visibility and knowledge over the entire business, which allow
decision makers to better adjust their strategies and define the most
valuable policies. According to all these ingredients, our findings suggest that SCs have operational and economic motivations to implement
blockchains when the variable cost due to the technology adoption,
implementation, integration and usage is not too high. In contrast, the
blockchain fixed cost and token value only have a marginal impact

whether our findings can be generalized. Furthermore, future research
can investigate the implications of other chain structures and check
how different power structures and leadership positions can affect
the results. This direction can be corroborated by endogenizing some
ingredients that we considered as exogenous in this research, like the
wholesale price and the fix cost for the blockchain implementation.
Our blockchain model is composed of one block only, consisting of
the transaction between the supplier and the retailer. Future research
can look at the existence of more blocks and, consequently, more firms
interacting within the SC, to see how the blockchain implications linked
to the consensus affect its suitability. For example, future research
can use the framework that we analyze as a benchmark and evaluate
it within some specific settings, like, Walmart and Dole, which we
mention in the introduction. We assume that the retailer covers the
entire cost for implementing a blockchain since she is most likely
affected by unsecure transactions. Future work can look at the area of
collaborative planning and SC coordination to establish collaborative
programs among firms pursuing blockchain projects. One interesting
feature of a blockchain is that it allows the SC to accumulate knowledge
over time and use this knowledge in the decision-making process.
Future research can then look at dynamic modeling where firms using
a blockchain accumulate knowledge through a dynamic equation and
exploit it when dynamically setting their strategies. We focus our analysis on service, pricing and quantity, while other ingredients like lead
time, quality, R&D, advertising, and location (just to mention a few)
can be further considered to investigate the blockchain’s advantages.
These features can lead to the analysis of new smart contracts
based on quantity (e.g., quantity discount), pricing (e.g., minimum suggested price), sales (e.g., sales rebate), or performance
achievements (e.g., strategic incentives). Future research can also
look at testing the results of this research through empirical studies or
through clinical cases. We have based parameter estimations, simulations, and framework according to a theoretical setting. Future research
can start the analysis of blockchain from a case study, develop the
parameter estimations accordingly, and run simulations within that
particular framework. The blockchain is only one technology linked to
the current digital transformation that has been analyzed. Other technologies (e.g., Industry 4.0) can complement our findings to investigate
the synergistic effects among them. This is a current research theme
that the authors are exploring.
