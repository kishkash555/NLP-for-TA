a b s t r a c t
We investigate consignment contracts with revenue-sharing for selling virtual products subject to information asymmetry. In practice, distribution platforms commonly use uniﬁed contracts with identical
revenue-sharing terms across the developers whose products they offer. We analyze the case of a developer who is better informed than his distribution platform regarding the demand. First, we prove that
the developer has no incentive to voluntarily disclose his private information and that cheap-talk is not
informative, so the distribution platform can either extract this information by designing a revelation
mechanism via a menu of contracts or propose a less complicated, suboptimal but commonly used uniﬁed contract. Based on optimal control theory, we develop a menu of contracts over a continuous demand
domain, which includes a mechanism that leaves out some developers who reduce the expected proﬁt of
the distribution platform. We ﬁnd that (i) the distribution platform is willing to share the developer’s cost
to make the developer act in accordance with the actual base demand; (ii) the menu of contracts is more
supportive of small businesses than the uniﬁed contract; and (iii) the menu of contracts can signiﬁcantly
improve the distribution platform’s expected proﬁt compared with that of the uniﬁed contract when the
app quality exceeds the minimum required level. In addition, we develop a mathematical model for the
case of an app developer who has the option of bypassing the distribution platform and selling his app
directly to end consumers, although he would then face a smaller market.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the market share
and variety of intangible (virtual) products, such as mobile apps,
software, gift cards and coupons, memberships, services and extended warranties (Chernonog & Avinadav, 2014). This increase is
largely a result of the proliferation of digital platforms for content consumption, as well as the development of the internet as
a direct channel for delivering goods and transferring payments
(Waelbroeck, 2013). Sales of virtual products have been generating
substantial and growing revenues. For example, in January 2018,
R
Apple
announced that customers had spent over $26 billion in
the App StoreSM in 2017—more than a 30% increase relative to
the previous year (Apple, 2018). Yet, the development of operations management models has apparently not kept pace with the
market. Traditional models, formulated primarily for tangible prod-

ucts, fail to capture key properties of intangible products and are
therefore of limited use to the digital retailer. In particular, many
of the parameters incorporated into traditional models are superﬂuous for products that are not held in inventory and that can be
produced (or delivered) in inﬁnite quantities and in a negligible
amount of time, after demand has been realized.
In this paper, we establish a consignment contract with
revenue-sharing that is commonly applied between developers of
virtual products and a distribution platform of such products (e.g.,
the iTunes App Store or Google Play). In such contracts, the developer continues to own the product and bears sole responsibility for
determining its selling price, whereas for every unit sold, the distribution platform charges an agreed-upon percentage of the selling price. In many cases, the distribution platform is much larger
than the developers whose products it offers, and is therefore in a
position to dictate the terms of the contract.
In practice, many prominent distribution platforms adopt a
uniﬁed contract across all their developers, as is the case for the
iTunes App Store and Google Play Store, which both keep 30% of
the revenues from the apps that they offer, with the developers
receiving 70% (see Hillegas (2012) and Google (n.d.)). However,
when the developer has enough power, he may refuse to accept

this uniﬁed contract and try to bypass the distribution platform to
save commission. For example, recently, Epic Games, the developer
of the popular online game Fortnite Battle Royale (more than 125
million downloads, according to Gilbert, 2018), decided not to use
Google Play as a distributor. Instead, it offers the game directly on
its own website. It was estimated that this decision would cost
Google about $50 million or more in platform fees in 2018 (Perez,
2018). Notably, Perez (2018) argues that Epic Games is also likely
to have suffered losses, as some Android users are likely to be
hesitant to download the game directly from Epic Games’ website
without Google’s security protections, and might instead gravitate
towards competing games that Google promotes in its store.
Another example is Netﬂix, which bypassed Apple’s iTunes-based
billing system to save the 30% commission, and requires new subscribers on iOS to sign up via its website rather than within the
Netﬂix App. This move of Netﬂix (https://www.forbes.com/sites/
greatspeculations/2019/01/02/how- much- does- apple- stand- to- loseas- netﬂix- stops- in- app- subscriptions/#2fbbd3b37589) may cause
a loss of at least $160 million per year for Apple.
Herein, we explore whether using a more sophisticated contract
design could enable developers and distribution platforms such as
Epic Games and Google to cooperate and increase the total supplychain proﬁts, which may lead to Pareto improvement. To do so, we
develop a virtual-product-relevant model and examine whether,
and to what extent, improving the uniﬁed revenue-sharing rule
(70−30%) by tailoring revenue shares according to speciﬁc features
of the parties is possible. Speciﬁcally, we suggest that the contract
should consider the market size of the virtual product and the information asymmetry between the two parties.
1.2. Information asymmetry
The topic of information asymmetry in supply chains has
received considerable research attention over the years. This
research stream is based on the premise that, when signing a
contract, the parties base their decision-making and planning
processes on the information available to them (e.g., about the anticipated demand), and that in many cases, different supply-chain
members are exposed to different sources of information (see, e.g.,
Shamir & Shin, 2016; Avinadav, Chernonog, Perlman, & Meilijson,
2020; Chernonog & Avinadav, 2018; Chu, Shamir, & Shin, 2016).
Speciﬁcally, whereas distribution platforms have point-of-sale data
and knowledge of their own investments in marketing, developers
study their consumers’ demographics and motivations, and thus
are likely to possess a broader understanding of the market and
the coming trends (Basker, 2016; Gal-Or, Geylani, & Dukes, 2008).
A widespread assumption in the operations management literature
is that the downstream member of a supply chain (in our case, the
distribution platform) is closer to customers than the upstream
member (the developer), and is therefore more familiar with the
demand. The reverse situation, in which the upstream member has
more precise information about the consumers, their preferences,
and thus the (anticipated) demand, is under-researched in the
operations management literature, despite the fact that it is highly
common in practice (as observed, for example, by Jiang, Tian, Xu,
& Zhang, 2016).
In three main scenarios of information asymmetry, the upstream member is better informed than the downstream member
regarding the demand for a speciﬁc product: (i) The downstream
member carries highly diverse product lines, whereas the upstream member concentrates on a more limited set of related
products (e.g., Apple iTunes as a distribution platform of diverse
mobile apps, and iGo Navigation as a developer of mobile apps
focused speciﬁcally on navigation); (ii) the upstream member
introduces a new product into the market (Berman, Fazel-Zarandi,
& Krass, 2019); and (iii) the upstream member produces a product

with a short life cycle or introduces a modiﬁed product (e.g., in
fashion markets). In these situations, the downstream member
may not be interested in investing in forecasting or may not have
historical data of sales. Upstream members, by contrast, are likely
to be motivated in these scenarios to obtain information regarding consumer preferences and demand through such means as
market research (hiring professional consultants such as Nielsen),
focus groups, product testing, or accessing syndicated research
(Guan & Chen, 2017). Moreover, Jiang, Jerath, and Srinivasan
(2011) provide evidence regarding niche products, according to
which an entrepreneurial and enterprising independent seller
may have more information than Amazon. For example, they
report that in April 2010, the “Digital SLR camera” category had
928 products listed in Amazon marketplace, where Amazon offered 16 of the top 20 best sellers but only 5 with sales ranks
from 150 to 250. In addition, retail industry experts suggest that
forecasts of greater accuracy can be achieved by combining the
Amazon Forecast service (announced in November 2018) with
additional factors (https://www.snowﬂake.com/blog/integratingsnowﬂake- data- with- amazon- forecast- part- 2/).
According
to
Ohsman (2019), a seller (the upstream member) can achieve a
better forecast than that obtained by using Amazon Forecast alone
by considering (i) any variables that inﬂuence the sales for the
selling period, such as a lost buy box or price pressures that originate on/off of Amazon; and (ii) promotional events, advertising
metrics, and so on. Notably, the few papers that have analyzed
scenarios in which the upstream member is better informed than
the downstream member (Chen, 2003; Guo & Iyer, 2010; Jiang
et al., 2016; Lariviere & Padmanabhan, 1997; Zhang & Chen, 2013)
assumed that the parties interact via a wholesale price contract.
Herein, we address this scenario in the context of revenue-sharing
contracts, thereby ﬁlling an important gap in the operations
management literature, while addressing questions with clear
practical relevance that have the potential to inﬂuence the proﬁts
of purveyors of virtual products.
1.3. Revenue-sharing contracts and information asymmetry
A literature review by Bart et al. (2020) reveals a paucity of research that combines revenue-sharing contracts with information
asymmetry. Gerchak and Khmelnitsky (2003) studied a consignment contract in which the supplier is less informed than the retailer about the demand, and he updates his beliefs about the demand distribution dynamically on the basis of the retailer’s sales
reports (which may or may not be truthful). Zhao, Wang, and Gan
(2016) and Hou, Zeng, and Zhao (2009) considered a consignment
contract in which the downstream party is not informed regarding the upstream party’s production cost and inventory holding
cost, respectively. Wang, Lau, and Hua (2012) studied a contract
in which a manufacturer-leader has probabilistic knowledge about
the demand function and the retail cost, whereas the retailer has
exact information about these two variables. Kong et al. (2013)
studied a contract in a two-echelon supply chain with a supplierleader and two retailers—incumbent and entrant—where the latter
is less informed about the demand. Xiao and Xu (2018) considered
an online retailer selling a seasonal product provided by an independent third-party seller who has superior information about the
demand potential of the product. Avinadav, Chernonog, and BenZvi (2019) studied the strategic information-sharing behavior of a
manufacturer who has private information regarding the demand,
where the retailer may or may not know that the manufacturer
has this information. Finally, three papers assumed that sales are
unobservable to the supplier: Heese and Kemahlioglu-Ziya (2014,
2016) and Gerchak, Khmelnitsky, and Robinson (2007), where
the latter paper assumed information asymmetry with regard to
the demand distribution and production cost as well. Note that

The present paper

Consignment contract with

none of the above papers has used a menu of contracts to tackle
the problem. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is
the ﬁrst to develop a menu of contracts using revenue sharing.
1.4. Voluntary disclosure and cheap talk
We explore mechanisms by which the better-informed party
might be driven to reveal his or her information truthfully to the
less-informed party. As one might expect, the less-informed party
always beneﬁts from information disclosure (Chernonog, 2019);
however, in some cases, the more-informed party also beneﬁts
from disclosing its private information to the less-informed party,
and therefore does so voluntarily (Alkoby, Sarne, & Milchtaich,
2017). The issue of voluntary disclosure (i.e., strategic revealing of
truthful information by free will) is relatively understudied in the
supply-chain management literature; yet it is common in practice,
and is typically manifested through informal communication between the upstream and downstream partners. Indeed, according
to Guo and Iyer (2010), many manufacturers share insights with
their retailers from time to time, though they do not contractually commit to sharing information on a long-term basis. The few
papers dealing with voluntary disclosure discuss the issue under
two main frameworks: information disclosure between ﬁrms and
customers, and information disclosure among supply-chain members. The ﬁrst framework usually deals with quality (Zhao, Dong, &
Cheng, 2018) and inventory (Aydinliyim, Pangburn, & Rabinovich,
2017; Cui & Shin, 2017) disclosure, whereas the second framework usually deals with disclosures of demand (Bertomeu & Liang,
2014), inventory (Chu & Lee, 2006), and various cost types (Chen
& Deng, 2014; Delaney & Thijssen, 2015). Within each framework,
consideration of both single-period (Gao, Li, & Shou, 2014; Guo, Li,
& Zhang, 2014) and multi-period (Chu & Lee, 2006; Delaney & Thijssen, 2015) models is possible.
In addition to voluntary disclosure, we investigate whether
“cheap-talk” can be used to exchange information between the app
developer and the distribution platform. The concept of meaningful cheap-talk refers to a situation in which private information
can be exchanged in a believable way through costless messages
(Crawford & Sobel, 1982, and recently in Shamir, 2012). Ren et al.
(2010) showed that cheap-talk can be meaningful when the parties
interact over an inﬁnite horizon. The main ﬁndings on the subject of cheap-talk can be summarized as follows: Shamir and Shin
(2016) reported that when two supply chains compete in the market, making private forecast information public can constitute in
meaningful cheap-talk; Chu et al. (2016) demonstrate that when
the value of sharing forecast information is high, cheap-talk can be
used to exchange information credibly Berman et al. (2019) con-

Agent’s decisions after contract
is proposed

sidered a manufacturer who has a private forecast about the likelihood of a new product release and/or about the uncertain demand
for the product, which he shares (either truthfully or not) with the
retailer; Avinadav and Shamir (2021) showed that in the presence
of partial vertical ownership, a retailer who is more informed than
the supplier can exchange information credibly about the market
condition with the supplier via cheap-talk. On the other hand, it is
well known that when ﬁrms in a supply chain interact using a simple wholesale price contract, meaningful cheap-talk does not lead
to an equilibrium (see, for example, Ozer et al., 2011; Avinadav &
Shamir, 2020). In this paper, we show that neither voluntary disclosure nor cheap-talk can be used to exchange information credibly.
1.5. Menu of contracts
When voluntary disclosure is unlikely to occur (i.e., when the
better-informed party does not expect to beneﬁt from revealing his
or her information) or when cheap-talk is not informative (i.e., it
is beneﬁcial for the better-informed party to distort its information), a menu of contracts can serve as an information-revelation
mechanism. This idea has been studied under the concept of “adverse selection” (starting with Myerson, 1979), a term that is used
to categorize principal-agent models in which an agent has private
information before the contract is signed. The eﬃcacy of a menu
of contracts as an information-revelation mechanism has recently
been tested in laboratory experiments and in the ﬁeld (Hoppe &
Schmitz, 2015). The vast majority of studies on menus of contracts
consider a ﬁnite number of possible agent types (in most cases,
two), whereas only a few studies (as presented in Table 1) designed menus that handle a continuous space, that is, an inﬁnite
number of agent types. Table 1 provides an overview of the literature to date that considers a menu of contracts under continuous space, where the models are classiﬁed according to a variety of characteristics. As one can see, none of these papers has
applied a menu of contracts with revenue sharing. In addition, in
our study the agent makes decisions (namely, the selling price and
quality level) beyond selecting the contract from the menu, which
is not very common in the literature – although it is common in
the practice of selling mobile apps.
1.6. Bypassing option
As an extension to the menu of contracts framework investigated herein, we develop a mathematical model for the case of
an app developer who has the option of bypassing the distribution platform and selling his app to end consumers directly, even

though he would then face a smaller market. The bypassing option is modeled via the reservation proﬁt of the app developer,
which is affected by the base demand. Our model is innovative
by virtue of the fact that it designs a menu of contracts that prevents the agent from bypassing the principal and “going it alone”.
Moreover, whereas in the operations management literature, the
reservation proﬁt of the agent is constant and unaffected by the
parameter that is unknown to the principal, in the current model,
the reservation proﬁt of the agent is type dependent. Clearly, in the
case where the app developer bypasses the distribution platform,
the proﬁt of the developer depends on the base demand (i.e., the
agent’s type), and thus, a type-dependent reservation proﬁt more
accurately reﬂects the real situation. To the best of our knowledge, only four papers have considered type-dependent reservation proﬁt (Cakanyıldırım, Feng, Gan, & Sethi, 2012; Chakravarty
& Zhang, 2007; Feng, Lai, & Lu, 2015; Gan, Feng, & Sethi, 2019),
where only the ﬁrst and last of these developed a menu of contracts in continuous space, as is the case in the present study.
However, whereas we consider information asymmetry with regard to the base demand, Chakravarty and Zhang (2007) considered it with regard to the cost of investing in service capacity and
Gan et al. (2019) considered it with regard to the unit production cost. Moreover, none of the above four papers investigated a
revenue-sharing contract, which is the focus of our study.

1.7. Contributions and ﬁndings
In what follows, we develop and analyze a model capturing the
formulation of a consignment contract with revenue-sharing between an app developer and a distribution platform, where the
latter is the leader of the supply chain and also possesses less information with regard to the demand. This paper makes four major
contributions to the literature:
◦ Investigating a menu of contracts that involves a consignment
contract with revenue-sharing, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been studied in the literature.
◦ Designing a menu of contracts in a continuous space, which
better reﬂects real situations, but is considerably more complex
than designing contracts in a discrete space (because it requires
more rigorous mathematical methods, such as optimal control).
◦ Proposing a mechanism that leaves out (ﬁlters) some developers who reduce the expected proﬁt of the distribution platform
– a mechanism that, in spite of its superiority, has rarely been
investigated in the literature.
◦ Extending the menu of contracts to consider an option in which
the app developer may bypass the distribution platform and
sell directly to end consumers.
In addition, we present the following results:
◦ Proving that voluntary disclosure of demand information is unbeneﬁcial for the app developer and that cheap-talk is not informative for the distribution platform.
◦ Finding a closed-form solution for equilibrium contract-terms
and proving that a shutdown policy (i.e., ﬁltering) is beneﬁcial
for the distribution platform.
◦ Showing that the use of a menu of contracts leads to a policy
in which the two parties effectively share the costs of the product’s development.
◦ Showing that a menu of contracts is more supportive of small
businesses than a uniﬁed contract.
◦ Finding that a menu of contracts can signiﬁcantly improve the
distribution platform’s expected proﬁt compared with the case
of a uniﬁed contract when the app quality exceeds a basic level.

2. Model formulation
Consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a single app
developer and a single distribution platform, who are about to engage in a contract with regard to the development and sale of the
app. The parties interact by using a revenue-sharing contract in
which the distribution platform is the leader and the app developer is the follower. Under this contract, the distribution platform
sets the app developer’s revenue share η and a transfer payment
(closing fee) T. In other words, T is a ﬁxed cost incurred by one
of the parties for the act of signing the contract, and its value can
be either positive, in which case the app developer pays the fee
to the distribution platform, or negative, in which case the distribution platform pays the fee to the app developer. The distribution platform offers the contract to the app developer, who sets
the unit selling price p and the quality level of the product q. The
quality level is assumed to reﬂect the app developer’s extent of
engagement in research and development, brand promotion, and
so on, beyond the basic level required to ensure the app meets
some minimal quality threshold (such as that required by the App
Store, which reviews all submitted apps in an effort to determine
whether they are reliable, perform as expected, and are free of offensive material; see https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/
rejections/). Given that the product is virtual, we assume the app
developer has ample production capacity and that neither party incurs transportation or holding costs. Demand is negatively affected
by the selling price and positively affected by the level of quality.
We adopt the additive demand form, which is commonly used in
the literature (e.g., Aust & Buscher, 2012; Avinadav, Chernonog, &
Perlman, 2015a,b; Chernonog, Avinadav, & Ben-Zvi, 2015; Huang,
Leng, & Parlar, 2013; Ma, Wang, & Shang, 2013):

D(q, p, a ) = a + α q − β p,

(1)

where a is the base demand, and α and β are the customer’s levels of sensitivity to price and to quality, respectively. The base demand a is unknown. It is estimated by the distribution platform
and the app developer (common knowledge) as a non-negative
random variable, deﬁned over the support , with a probability
density function f (· ), a cumulative distribution function F (· ), and
mean E[a].
We further consider the costs, C(q), that the app developer incurs as a result of his investment in quality. In particular, we use

C (q ) = c +

γ q2
2

,

(2)

where c is a ﬁxed cost required to achieve a basic quality level, as
noted above. The parameter γ is a scale coeﬃcient that reﬂects the
eﬃcacy of the app developer’s investment in quality. A low value
of γ implies that the app developer’s investment is more effective. The assumption of a quadratic cost function reﬂects the law
of diminishing returns and is commonly used in the operations
management literature (see, e.g., Lau, Lau, & Wang, 2010; Ma et al.,
2013; Wang, Wang, & Shou, 2013).
In what follows, we assume

γ ≥ α 2 / ( 2β ).

(3)

As is shown in the proof of Lemma 2, this assumption circumvents cases in which using inﬁnitely large price and quality
levels is beneﬁcial due to high eﬃcacy of investment in quality. Similar arguments are given in Savaskan, Bhattacharya, and
Van Wassenhove (2004) and in Avinadav, Chernonog, and Perlman
(2017, 2020).
For a given level of base demand, a, the app developer’s and the
distribution platform’s actual proﬁts are, respectively,

πAD (q, p|η, T , a ) ≡ η pD(q, p, a ) − C (q ) − T ,

(4)

πDP (η, T |q, p, a ) ≡ (1 − η ) pD(q, p, a ) + T .

We investigate the case of an app developer who is able to observe a prior to the selling period. The distribution platform lacks
this information (the value of a), but is aware that the app developer has it – a situation referred to by Lau and Lau (2001) as
“known superiority”. This scenario of information allocation corresponds to the principal-agent framework with adverse selection (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991), where the distribution platform
is the principal and the app developer is the agent who holds private information. As noted above, and further elaborated upon in
Chernonog (2019), for some values of a, the app developer (the
more informed party) beneﬁts from disclosing his private information, whereas the distribution platform (the less informed party)
always stands to beneﬁt from information disclosure.
3. Should the app developer deliver a message about his
private information?
We start by investigating whether it is beneﬁcial for the app
developer to distort the base-demand information that it shares
with the distribution platform. Suppose the actual base demand is
a, whereas the app developer reports that the base demand is κ . If
the distribution platform believes the app developer, her strategy
(ηd , T d ) is obtained by solving
max {πDP (η, T |qκ (η, T ), pκ (η, T ), κ )}
η,T

S.t. (qκ (η, T ), pκ (η, T )) = arg max {πAD (q, p|η, T , κ )}
p,q

πAD (qκ (η, T ), pκ (η, T )|η, T , κ ) ≥ 0
0≤η≤1

(ADBR )
(IR )

The strategy of the app developer is obtained by solving
max{πAD (q, p|ηd , T d , a )}. The following lemma provides the correp,q

sponding contract terms and the parties’ proﬁts. The proof of this
lemma, along with the proofs of all other lemmas, propositions and
theorems, are given in the Appendix.
Lemma 1.

4. Menu of contracts
To maximize its expected proﬁt, the distribution platform designs a menu of contracts {η (a ), T (a )}, where each contract is intended for a speciﬁc realization of the base demand a. From the
revelation principle (Myerson, 1979), the distribution platform can
design a direct-revelation mechanism that induces the app developer to truthfully disclose the base demand through his choice of
contract from the menu; that is, he is forced to choose contract a
when the base demand is a. Fig. 1 depicts the sequence of events
in the model.
Clearly, the distribution platform will propose a menu of contracts {η (a ), T (a )} to the app developer that screens out cases
in which he loses from interacting with the app developer. The
screening is achieved by proposing a menu of contracts only for

By Theorem 1, credible information sharing is not feasible; thus,
the distribution platform should decide whether to use a revelation mechanism via a menu of contracts or to propose a uniﬁed
contract based on the estimated distribution of the base demand.
In what follows, we analyze the supply-chain members’ strategies
in each scenario and compare the performance of the different approaches.

According to Lemma 1, the distribution platform makes the app
developer act as though they are operating in a centralized supply
chain by setting ηd = 1, thus maximizing the proﬁt of the entire
channel. However, the distribution platform sets the value of T d
such that it obtains all of the channel proﬁt, leaving zero proﬁt for
the app developer. Indeed, when the app developer shares his private information truthfully (i.e., κ = a), this is exactly the result,1
and thus it is not beneﬁcial for the app developer to provide a
truthful report. Consequently, since the proﬁt of the app developer
decreases in κ , it is in the developer’s interests to report the lowest
possible value of the base demand, in order to reduce his closing
fee. As a result, a rational distribution platform would not consider
the shared information as credible. Therefore:
Theorem 1. Cheap-talk is not informative for the distribution platform and voluntary disclosure is not beneﬁcial for the app developer.
1
A similar result is known for a standard two-part tariff contract that is based on
a wholesale price agreement (see e.g., Li and Liu, 2015) initiated by a downstream
member under the assumption of complete information. According to this contract,
the dominant upstream player can set the wholesale price to be equal to his costs
(to create the conditions of a centralized supply chain), and can select T so as to
grab all of the channel proﬁt.

AD

(a, κ ) ≡ πAD (qa (η (κ ), T (κ )), pa (η (κ ), T (κ ))|η (κ ), T (κ ), a)
(8)

is the app developer’s proﬁt when he chooses a contract corresponding to base demand κ when the actual base demand is a. The
ADBR constraint in (7) provides the app developer’s best response
for a given (η, T ) when the base demand is a. The IC constraints
are referred to, in contract theory, as incentive-compatibility constraints; these constraints give the app developer incentives to act
truthfully, that is, to choose the contract intended for the demand
he faces. Actually, we split the IC constraint into constraints IC1
and IC2 in order to distinguish between two types of app developer. The ﬁrst type is an app developer with whom the distribution platform wishes to play (i.e., an app developer with a base
demand that belongs to η (a ),T (a ) ), whereas the second type is an
app developer with whom the distribution platform does not wish
to play (i.e., an app developer with a base demand that belongs to
/ η (a),T (a) ). Such an approach has been suggested by Laffont and
Martimort (2002) and Ha (2001) in the context of supplier-buyer
contracting with asymmetric cost information. In this paper, the
IR constraints constitute a necessary condition to ensure that the
app developer with whom the distribution platform wishes to play
does not lose money when he truthfully reveals his demand information. In order to formulate (7) explicitly, we use the following
two lemmas:

With the new variables, we formulate the following problem,

By Lemma 3(i), the revelation principle (see Myerson, 1979;
Weber, 2011) is implementable in our problem, because η (a )
and T (a ) are monotone functions. Moreover, we obtain the result that when the base demand increases, the distribution platform charges the app developer a higher ﬁxed transfer payment
but compensates him with a higher share of the revenue. Since
Lemma 3(i) provides only necessary conditions for the IC constraints to hold, we will additionally verify that κ = a globally maximizes AD (a, κ ), after determining the exact expressions of η(a)
and T(a) in the next section.

4.1. Solution method
This section develops optimality conditions for problem (9) and
a solution method, which determines the menu of contracts
{η (a ), T (a )} that solves the problem. To this end, we introduce two
new state variables, ξ (a ) and S(a ), which replace η (a ) and T (a ), as
follows:

where u(a ) is the controllable rate of S(a ). Constraints (11b) and
(11c) represent the IC1 constraint in (9). Note that the condition
cα 2
S(a ) ≥ − βγ
2 is equivalent to T (a ) ≥ −c. If the latter condition is

violated, the solution can be improved by increasing T(a), because,
by Lemma 2(i), the transfer payment T(a) does not affect the marketing and operational decisions of the app developer (price and
quality level). Constraint (11d) represents the IR constraint in problem (9). Constraint (11e) represents the constraint 0 ≤ η (a ) ≤ 1 in
problem (9).
Problem (11) is not of a regular setting, because the dynamics of
the state variables in (11b) and (11c) and the interval, , on which
the variables are deﬁned are not independent. To resolve this issue
and convert the problem into a canonical optimization form, we
carry out the following procedure:
Step 1. Prove the set
consists of a single, inﬁnite interval,
=
[a0 , ∞ ), where a0 will be determined in Step 6.
Step 2. Solve problem (11) for ﬁxed arbitrary a0 and S(a0 ) = S0 .
Step 3. Analyze the solution and show that its structure is the
same for all a0 and S0 .
Step 4. Find S0 from (11d).
Step 5. After plugging the optimal solution from Step 2 and S0
from Step 4 into the objective function (11a), the latter
becomes dependent on a single unknown, a0 .
Step 6. Maximize (11a), analytically or numerically, as a function
of a0 , and obtain the optimal solution.
Step 1 of the solution method follows from the fact that the
derivative of the left-hand side of the inequality in (11d) is not
smaller than that of the right-hand side; that is,

proves that the IC2 constraint holds, so the optimal solution of
problem (11) is equivalent to that of problem (9).
By ﬁxing the parameters a0 and S(a0 ) = S0 in Step 2, the solution of (11) is determined by analyzing the optimality conditions
formulated in the form of the maximum principle (Hartl, Sethi, &
Vickson, 1995). According to this formulation, if ξ (a ), S(a ), and
u(a ) solve the problem, then costate variables, ψξ (a ) and ψS (a ),
exist such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:

where dμ1 (· ) and dμ2 (· ) are measure functions. We note that the
Hamiltonian function is linear in u(a ), and that its maximization
subject to constraint u(a ) ≥ 0 results in

Type-1 arc: contracts that are indifferent to the value of the
base demand; that is, u(a ) = 0, over an interval of demand
values;
Type-2 arc: contracts that are sensitive to the value of the base
demand; that is, u(a ) ≥ 0.
The latter category is also termed “singular” because the control
function cannot be explicitly determined from maximization of the
Hamiltonian, and additional analysis is required. Let a singular arc
occur at an interval of a, that is,

ψξ ( a ) + a2 ψS ( a ) = 0.

(18)

Then, over the arc,

ψS (a ) = 1 − F (a ) and ψξ (a ) = a2 (F (a ) − 1 ).
 

(19)

The control function u(a) and S(a) are explicitly obtained from
state Eqs. (11b) and (11c). To simplify further the analysis, we assume the demand distribution function is such that

d m (a )

a

≤ 0 (i.e., m (a ) ≤

m (a )

(20)

which is valid for many demand distributions.

The next lemma determines the structure of the optimal solution and proves that it consists of a type-1 arc followed by a type2 arc. We denote the switching point between the two arcs by ā.
Note that, for some parameter values, one of the two arcs can disappear.
Lemma 5.
(i) If a0 < ā, the optimal solution consists of two arcs:


By Theorem 2, if ā > 2 β c, then for a low market (i.e.,a ∈

[2 β c, ā]), the app developer has no share in the revenues, and
thus he does not invest in increasing quality beyond its basic level.
The distribution platform compensates the app developer by a
transfer payment that is equal to the ﬁxed cost required to achieve
the basic quality level. In return, the app developer sets the selling price proportionally to the base demand. Whereas the app developer has no proﬁt and no losses in this domain, the distribution platform’s proﬁt is an increasing convex non-negative function

of the base demand. In other words, the case in which ā > 2 β c
represents a scenario in which the ﬁxed cost required to achieve
the basic quality level is low enough to generate proﬁts to the
supply chain. Under this scenario, for a high market (i.e., a ≥ ā),
the app developer develops a high-quality product and
 gains a
share of the revenue. On the other hand, the case ā ≤ 2 β c represents a scenario in which the ﬁxed cost required to achieve the
basic quality level is suﬃciently high such that it is only possible to generate proﬁts by developing high-quality products. By
Theorem 2(i), under a high market (i.e.,a ≥ ā), for both scenarios,
the app developer’s share of the revenue increases as the base demand increases. In addition, by simple calculus combined with the
assumption in (20), when the base demand increases, the transfer payment from the app developer to the distribution platform
(T > 0) increases, whereas the transfer payment from the distribution platform to the app developer (T < 0) decreases. These results are necessary for the existence of a revelation mechanism
(see Lemma 3(i)). By Theorem 2(ii) and the condition in (21), both
the selling price and the quality level are increasing functions of
the base demand. Note that in both cases, the developer’s proﬁt is
independent of the ﬁxed cost required to achieve the basic quality
level, because this cost is totally borne by the distribution platform
as a part of the revelation mechanism.
Corollary 1. (i) AD (a, a ) and T (a ) are convex increasing functions
of a. (ii) πDP (a ) is an increasing continuous function of a.
The expected proﬁt of the distribution platform and the
∞
app developer are, respectively, E[πDP ] = a πDP (a ) f (a )da and
0

∞

E[ AD (a, a )] = a
AD (a, a ) f (a )da. Similarly, we calculate the ex0
pected values of η (a ), T (a ), p(a ), and q(a ).

In what follows, we ﬁnd the optimal menu of contracts for two
common distributions of the base demand that satisfy the condition in (20): exponential and normal.
Example 1. Let a be distributed exponentially, a ∼ Exp(λ ), so that

(ā ) = 2βγ . For parameter values

α = 1, β = 1.1, γ = 0.8, μ = 100 and σ = 20, the switching point

is ā = 86. We implemented the solution method for two values of
parameter c: c = 10 0 0 and c = 40 0 0. The optimal a0 in the ﬁrst
case (a0 = 66.3) is smaller than ā, whereas in the second case
(a0 = 105.6), it is greater than ā. Accordingly, the optimal menu
of contracts {η (a ), T (a )} consists of the two arcs, before and after
ā, in the ﬁrst case, and of a single, type-2 arc in the second case.
Fig. 2 depicts η (a ) and T (a ). The plots of η (a ) coincide because
η (a ) does not depend on c (although its domain does). In contrast,
the plots show that for a higher cost of achieving the basic quality
level, c, the app developer pays a lower transfer fee to the distribution platform. When the base demand is very low, the distribution
platform pays the transfer fee to the app developer (i.e., T < 0) in
order to encourage him to participate in the game. Fig. 3 illustrates
the tradeoff in the contract terms proposed to the app developer. It
shows that for a higher value of the ﬁxed cost required to achieve
a basic quality level, c, the domain of the contracts proposed to
the app developer is narrower in terms of η and T. Fig. 4 presents
the proﬁts of the app developer and the distribution platform as
a function of the base demand. As expected, a lower value of the
ﬁxed cost required to achieve a basic quality level, c, is better for
both parties. Note that for low values of the base demand, the distribution platform gains higher proﬁts than the app developer, and
vice versa for high values of the base demand. Fig. 5 shows that
the quality level and the selling price are non-decreasing functions
of the base demand. Similar to the plots of η(a), the plots of p(a )
and q(a ) for c = 10 0 0 and c = 40 0 0 coincide because neither p(a )
nor q(a ) depends on c (although their domains do). The expected
values of the solution parameters are shown in Table 2.
In addition, we show the sensitivity of the expected proﬁts of
the two parties with respect to the demand uncertainty (Fig. 6).

To do that, we use two base examples: the case of c = 10 0 0 and
the case of c = 40 0 0, where the values of parameter σ vary from
5 to 30 (to satisfy μ ≥ 3 13 σ ). Fig. 6 shows that when the standard deviation of the demand increases, the platform’s expected
proﬁt ﬁrst decreases and then increases, resulting in a quasiconvex behavior. This result is in line with the observation of
Wang, Yang, Wang and Wang (2018), according to which the principal prefers two extreme cases - symmetric information or totally

5. Uniﬁed contract
As discussed in the introduction, in the domain of virtual products for distribution platforms, it is common for platforms to offer
uniﬁed contracts across all the developers with whom they interact. In our model, this is equivalent to a scenario in which the distribution platform proposes a single set of contract terms (η, T ) to
the app developer, regardless of the realization of a. This type of
contract cannot force the app developer to reveal his private information; yet, at the same time, it enables the distribution platform
to avoid bearing the cost of the revelation mechanism. Therefore,
in this case, instead of imposing IC and IR constraints, we can deﬁne a subdomain of  (denoted η,T ) that reﬂects the values of
the base demand for which the app developer will agree to play.
Accordingly, the distribution platform’s problem can be formulated
as



Using (3) and the results of Lemma 2, problem (26) can be written as
asymmetric information. The authors explained this phenomenon
by the combined effect of the shutdown policy and information
rents. Fig. 6 also shows that the app developer’s expected proﬁt
increases monotonically. The intuitive explanation of this result is
that as the demand uncertainty increases the value of the exact
information about demand becomes higher, implying an increase
in the information rent paid by the distribution platform to the
app developer. The results above are observed both for the case of
c = 10 0 0 and the case of c = 40 0 0. In the numerical implementation we used the regular (untruncated) normal distribution to
model the demand, as was justiﬁed when the mean of the normal
distribution is suﬃciently larger than the standard deviation, and,
as a result, the probability of negative values is negligibly small

6. Menu of contracts vs. uniﬁed contract
6.1. Numerical example
Herein, we use a numerical example to compare the performance of the supply chain under three scenarios: a menu of
contracts and a uniﬁed contract for the asymmetric information
case, and a contract for the complete information case. The third
scenario serves as a benchmark to investigate how information
asymmetry distorts the contract compared with the symmetrical
case. In Section 3, we showed that the total proﬁt, the selling price
and the app quality under the third scenario are identical to those
obtained by a centralized supply chain. We assume a base demand that follows an exponential distribution with λ = 0.01 (i.e.,
the expected demand is 100 units) and the following parameter
values: α = 1, β = 1.1, c = 15, where the scale coeﬃcient of the

investment eﬃciency of the app developer is γ = 0.6. Under these
parameter values, the distribution platform screens out app developers whose base demand is lower than 8.124 when using a menu
of contracts, or lower than 132 when using a uniﬁed contract.
Under the complete information scenario, however, the parties
interact for any value of the base demand. This example shows a
substantial difference in the shutdown policy under the different
scenarios. In particular, compared with the uniﬁed contract, the
menu of contracts is more supportive of small businesses, which
presents a signiﬁcant social advantage. The numerical example
further shows that under the uniﬁed contract, 67.6% of app developers will be excluded from playing, whereas under a menu of
contracts, only 7.8% will be screened out. The rationale behind this
result is the additional ﬂexibility of a menu of contracts, which
enables the distribution platform to stay proﬁtable even when the
base demand is low.
Fig. 7 depicts the contract terms and various supply-chain measures as a function of the actual base demand under each scenario.
Speciﬁcally, Fig. 7(a) plots the app developer’s revenue share under the three scenarios. We see that under the menu of contracts,
the distribution platform gives a higher share of the revenue to
the app developer when the base demand is higher. Above a certain value of the base demand, the revenue share of the app developer is greater under a menu of contracts than under the uniﬁed
contract. Under the complete information scenario, the distribution
platform, on the one hand, gives all of the revenue to the app developer, but on the other hand, selects the transfer payment so as
to take all of the proﬁt, as was discussed in Section 3. Fig. 7(b)
shows that under a menu of contracts, the distribution platform
compensates herself for giving a higher share of the revenue to
the app developer when the base demand is higher by charging
a higher transfer payment. Similarly, under the complete information scenario, the transfer payment increases in the base demand,
whereas under the uniﬁed contract, by deﬁnition, it remains ﬁxed.
Fig. 7(c)–(e) show that the selling price, the app quality, and the
sales are non-decreasing functions of the actual base demand. We
further observe that, in comparison with a menu of contracts, the
uniﬁed contract results in a higher (lower) quality, a higher (lower)
selling price, and higher (lower) sales when the actual base demand is low (high). In addition, the values of these three variables
under complete information are always higher than those under

information asymmetry. Fig. 7(f)–(h) show that, as expected, the
proﬁts of each chain member, and thus also the total channel’s
proﬁt, increase in the base demand. The following results are particularly noteworthy: (i) for very low domains of the base demand,
only the menu of contracts leads to an interaction, but the app
developer is not proﬁtable; (ii) in cases where the base demand
is low, but both parties are proﬁtable, the uniﬁed contract is the
preferred option for both of them; (iii) for medium values of the
base demand, the distribution platform prefers the menu of contracts, whereas the app developer prefers the uniﬁed contract; (iv)
for high values of the base demand, both parties prefer the menu
of contracts; (v) for very high values of the base demand, the distribution platform prefers the uniﬁed contract (note that this occurs beyond the domain presented in Fig. 7(h)), whereas the app
developer prefers the menu of contracts. Fig. 7(f)–(h) illustrate the
results of Lemma 1, according to which, under complete information, the distribution platform grabs all of the channel proﬁt and
leaves zero proﬁt for the app developer.
In what follows, we conduct a sensitivity analysis regarding the
app developer’s eﬃcacy in quality investment to investigate the
values of the objective functions at equilibrium under three scenarios: a menu of contracts and a uniﬁed contract for the asymmetric information case, and a contract for the complete information case. Fig. 8(a)–(c) show that, as expected, when the app
developer’s investment in quality becomes less effective, the expected proﬁt of each chain member, and thus also the expected
total proﬁt, decreases. By the contracts’ deﬁnitions, a menu of contracts is clearly more proﬁtable to the distribution platform than
a uniﬁed contract (which can be captured by a menu of contracts
with an additional constraint), as shown in Fig. 8(a). On the other
hand, one contract type does not dominate the other for the app
developer. In particular, the greater the eﬃcacy of the app developer’s investment in quality (lower values of γ ), the better off the
developer is with the uniﬁed contract (see Fig. 8(b)), because a
uniﬁed contract is designed for an “average” market. The expected
total proﬁt of the supply chain is higher under a menu of contracts than under the uniﬁed contract for all values of γ used in
the analysis (see Fig. 8(c)). Fig. 8 also illustrates that the complete information scenario yields the ﬁrst-best solution from the
perspective of both the distribution platform and the total supply
chain.

6.2. Experimental design
In this section, we investigate the extent to which the uniﬁed
contract approximates the eﬃciency of the menu of contracts.
We do so by using a factorial experimental design according to
which γ = 0.3 and for each of the other parameters, we use
three levels and calculate the performance of each contract for
all combinations of the parameter levels. In particular, we use the
following baseline values: α = 0.6, β = 1.5, c = 15, λ = 0.0025,
and the low and high levels are then obtained by deviating from
these values by ±30%. This design results in 34 = 81 settings. We
measure the improvement in the distribution platform’s expected
proﬁt due to using a menu of contracts. Fig. 9 presents the degree of improvement (in a descending order) plotted against the

percentage of cases for which it was observed. It can be seen that
for about 44.5% of cases, the improvement was low (up to 5.5%),
whereas for about 55.5% of cases, the improvement was moderate
or high (between 7.5% and 19%). Interestingly, low-improvement
cases were characterized by parameter values that do not encourage investment in quality beyond its basic level, and vice
versa.
We further analyzed the effect on the app developer’s expected
proﬁts, and on the expected proﬁts of the entire channel, of replacing the uniﬁed contract with a menu of contracts. We found
that for ≈66.7% of the settings, the menu of contracts increased
the expected proﬁt of the app developer, whereas for the remainder of the settings, the opposite result was achieved. We further
found that in all settings, there was an improvement in the total

channel’s expected proﬁt (i.e., Kaldor–Hicks improvement), with an
average incremental improvement of ≈8.4%.
In order to evaluate the improvement in the channel proﬁt due
to shifting from a uniﬁed contract to a menu of contracts, we used
the ﬁrst-best solution (centralized supply chain) as a benchmark.
Speciﬁcally, we calculated the channel eﬃciency measure, i.e., the
ratio between the total proﬁt of both players and that of the centralized supply chain (Avinadav, Chernonog, & Perlman, 2014; Lau
& Lau, 2005; Lau, Su, Wang, & Hua, 2012), for each contract and
for all combinations of the parameter levels. We found that the
channel eﬃciency under the uniﬁed contract ranges from 53.5% to
84.9%, with an average value of 69.6%, whereas under the menu of
contracts, the channel eﬃciency ranges from 70.2% to 85.1% with
an average value of 74.6%. Fig. 10 illustrates the percentage improvement in the channel eﬃciency due to using a menu of contracts instead of a uniﬁed contract, where the improvement values are displayed in descending order. The degree of improvement
can be classiﬁed into three levels, which follow the Pareto rule:
high (19−31%), which captures 22% of the observations; medium
(5−9%), which captures 33% of the observations; and low (below
3%), which captures 45% of the observations.

7. Extension: menu of contracts under bypassing option
This section develops an optimal menu of contracts for the case
where an app developer has the option of bypassing the distribution platform and selling its app directly to the end customers. To
be able to do so, the app developer has to create a downloading
portal and a billing system at a cost of cBP . In addition, the base
demand is reduced by a factor θ (< 1 ), since potential customers
might be concerned about downloading an app that does not originate from the oﬃcial site of the distribution platform, and since
the latter might promote competing apps. Following Lemma 2(ii),
the reservation proﬁt of the app developer from bypassing the

The solution method for problem (28) is similar to that described in Section 4.1. The only difference is that the analysis is
now split into two cases, resulting in different shapes of the optimal menu of contracts. This follows from the presence of the
BP (a ), which impacts the solution through the connew function πAD
straints IC2 and IR. In order to introduce the two cases, we denote
the demand level at which the reservation proﬁt is zero by aˆ, i.e.,


BP
πAD
aˆ = 0,

and we set up case 1, where aˆ ≤ ā, and accordingly case 2, where
aˆ > ā.
In case 1, the reservation proﬁt function is relatively high, so in
the low market domain, the developer’s proﬁt corresponds to its
lower bound, and the developer’s share is constant (type-1 arc):

In Case 2, the reservation proﬁt function is low. Similar to the
case where there is no reservation proﬁt from bypassing, considered in Section 4, the solution consists of a type-1 arc followed by
a type-2 arc with the switching point at ā. The constant share of
each party at the type-1 arc now depends on the location of the
point a satisfying (29).
Example 3. Let a be distributed normally, a ∼ N (μ, σ 2 ). For
the parameter values α = 1, β = 1.1, γ = 0.8, μ = 100, σ = 20,
c = 10 0 0, and cBP = 20 0, Fig. 11 plots the expected proﬁt of the
two parties as a function of θ . The results show that as the reduction in the base demand due to bypassing the distribution platform
becomes less signiﬁcant (i.e., higher values of θ ), the app developer’s expected proﬁt increases whereas the distribution platform’s
expected proﬁt decreases. This result is intuitive because higher
values of θ make the bypassing option more attractive for the app
developer, so in order to prevent this scenario from occurring, the
distribution platform has to propose better contract terms to the
app developer.
8. Conclusion
This work investigated revenue-sharing contract designs for a
supply chain comprising a distribution platform of virtual products
that is the leader of the supply chain, and a developer of a single
virtual product who is more informed about the demand than the
distribution platform. First, we investigated whether conditions exist under which the app developer beneﬁts from disclosing his private information voluntarily. We proved that voluntary disclosure
leads to a situation in which the distribution platform achieves
the proﬁt of a centralized supply chain, whereas the app developer sees no proﬁt from the interaction, due to the transfer payment. Moreover, we showed that the app developer has an interest
in distorting his private information, so cheap-talk cannot be used
to exchange information credibly. Thus, regardless of the realization of the base demand, the app developer will never voluntarily
disclose his private information, leaving the distribution platform
to decide whether to extract the information by designing a revelation mechanism via a menu of contracts, or to propose a less

complicated but commonly used uniﬁed contract, which is suboptimal.
Using optimal control theory, we developed a menu of contracts
in which the contract terms offered by the distribution platform—
namely, the revenue share and ﬁxed transfer payment—serve as an
information-revelation mechanism, as well as a ﬁlter for excluding developers with whom it is undesirable to interact. We provided formulas to calculate not only the contract terms, but also
the quality and the selling price, as well as the proﬁts of the developer, the distribution platform, and the total supply chain. We
found that, in equilibrium, the distribution platform is willing to
share the developer’s cost of making the developer act in accordance with the actual base demand. Speciﬁcally, the distribution
platform bears the ﬁxed cost required to achieve a basic quality
level (via the transfer payment), whereas the developer bears the
investment required to enhance quality beyond the basic level. This
cost-sharing strategy results in ﬁltering out developers who reduce
the distribution platform’s expected proﬁt. Another interesting result is that the transfer payment may change its ‘direction’: When
the value of the base demand is low, the distribution platform pays
the app developer to avoid loss, whereas when the value of the
base demand is high, the app developer pays the distribution platform and gains a share of the revenue. To illustrate the usefulness
of our formulas, we applied them to two common distributions
of the base demand: exponential and normal. For the exponential
case, we proved that leaving out low-type developers always beneﬁts the distribution platform.
We subsequently investigated a uniﬁed contract that distribution platforms commonly use to determine the contract terms so
as to maximize their expected proﬁt based solely on their own
knowledge about the demand. Comparing the two types of contract, we found that (i) the menu of contracts is more supportive of small businesses than the uniﬁed contract; (ii) a menu of
contracts can signiﬁcantly improve the distribution platform’s expected proﬁt compared with that of the uniﬁed contract when the
app quality exceeds its basic level; and (iii) by using a menu of
contracts, the distribution platform can improve its expected proﬁt
by up to approximately 19%, while the channel eﬃciency can be
improved by up to 31%. In addition, we developed a mathematical model for the case of an app developer who has the option
of bypassing the distribution platform and selling his app to end
consumers directly, although he would then face a smaller market.
One direction for future research is to develop a similar model
for tangible products that considers overage and underage inventory costs (newsvendor model). Another direction is to investigate
the generality of our results by using a Cobb-Douglas demand
form for price and quality. In addition, we propose an important
direction for future research regarding how the outcomes of the
contracts would change if the parameters of the app developer’s
quality cost were not observable by the distribution platform.
Finally, we suggest investigating a supply chain with horizontal
competition between two distribution platforms: an incumbent
distribution platform that knows the demand, and a new entrant
who lacks this information.

Proof of Lemma 4. By the deﬁnition of m(a): For a ∼ Exp(λ ),
m(a ) = 1/λ, and so m (a ) = 0. For a ∼ N (μ, σ 2 ), m(a ) =
σ [1 − ( a−σμ )]/φ ( a−σμ ), where φ (· ) and (· ) are the standard
normal probability density function and cumulative distribution
function, respectively. By Laplace’s upper bound on the Mills ratio,

In such a case, a type-2 arc does not exist, because (19) contradicts constraint (11e). As a result, the solution consists of a

In such a case, a type-2 arc covers the entire a-domain, because

does not exist.
Case 3. The case complementary to Cases 1 and 2 implies that a
switching point ā exists between the two arcs, as stated in the
proposition.
