Nowadays, some suppliers are looking for oﬄine expansion in addition to their preexisting online channels relying on e-tailers. This study focuses on the e-tailer’s demand information sharing strategy with
the supplier who may build upon brick-and-mortar stores. Both prevailing agreements between the supplier and the e-tailer are investigated: agency selling and reselling. The equilibrium results are quite different under these two agreements. Speciﬁcally, when the supplier’s oﬄine entry cost is very small or
large, the e-tailer shares information under agency selling while keeps information private under reselling. When the entry cost is intermediate, channel substitution rate is large and information uncertainty is small, the e-tailer withholds the demand information under agency selling while shares information under reselling to deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel. Furthermore, two extensions about consumer behavior in multichannel selection are discussed: showrooming and webrooming.
With showrooming or webrooming, the e-tailer’s information sharing decisions qualitatively hold, while
with showrooming the drive factor behind may change; that is, withholding information under agency
selling and sharing information under reselling may also serve as measures to encourage supplier oﬄine
entry when the effect of showrooming is strong.

1. Introduction
The last decade has witnessed a strong growth in online retailing, and the online retailing sales worldwide were reported to
reach $2.304 trillion in 2017, a 24.8% increase over the previous
year (eMarketer, 2018). E-commerce has been occupying market
share previously dominated by physical stores, which made up
10.2% of total retail sales worldwide in 2017, up from 8.6% a year
prior (eMarketer, 2018). So will brick-and-mortar stores give way to
e-commerce? “Online-only will not survive, all businesses need to
intergrate online and oﬄine resources”, Jianlin Wang, the chairman
of Dalian Wanda Group (ranking 18th in Forbes’ 2017 World’s Billionaires list) said (CKGSB, 2017). In fact, a couple of suppliers who
have traditionally sold products through e-tailers in online channels, have switched back to go into brick-and-mortar retail shops,
with the goal of providing customers with a seamless shopping experience through all available shopping channels. A typical example is Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone vendor, who previously sold
products through a large online retail platform, JD.com, has opened
oﬄine retail stores and sold products directly to consumers oﬄine,

in a bid to make all products more accessible (Daily, 2017). Such
an oﬄine expansion strategy appears to be paying off since Xiaomi
bounces back with a 70% increase in shipments compared with the
previous quarter (CNET, 2017). Another successful Tao Brand (the
term Tao Brand refers to brand that built their presence on Tmall
or Taobao, without physical stores) who expands to oﬄine outlets
beyond Taobao is Inman, a women’s apparel brand. On May 2016,
the sales from all of Inman’s physical stores reached RMB 20 million (CKGSB, 2017).
Opening direct-sales stores allows the suppliers to better decide
on promotions, product categories and link online orders and ofﬂine stores for faster delivery. For example, BESTORE, a snack company who sells products through both the online platform Tmall
and its direct oﬄine stores, spent only 11 minutes to deliver the
Double-11 product to a consumer by sending out the order to the
consumer from the nearest store (CKGSB, 2017). Oﬄine expansion
endows the suppliers with more brand inﬂuence, better consumer
shopping experience and huger potential market, which has become an increasingly important strategic concern for these suppliers who begin with online businesses.
Meanwhile, the rapid development of Internet information
technologies has radically altered the landscape for collecting
and processing consumer information. Numerous e-tailers have

S. Zhang and J. Zhang / European Journal of Operational Research 280 (2020) 134–151

installed data acquisition infrastructures that allow them to routinely collect large data sets of customer-level information dubbed
“big data” (Choe, King, & Matsushima, 2017). For example, Amazon’s Web logs gather over 30 gigabytes of data every day (Guo,
2009). With Internet information technologies, the e-tailers can
construct a richer picture of customers’ proﬁles, and thus analyze
the potential consumers more accurately, locate consumer segments more appropriately, and forecast market demand more precisely. For example, Amazon is able to keep abreast of any shifts in
consumers’ needs and to better understand market demands via
various tools, such as “Amazon Daily” (where topics on diverse
interests are hosted to strengthen interaction among customers
and Amazon), “Web Forums” (which allows users to answer each
others’ questions), “Amapedia” (which invites consumers to share
purchase experiences and product details) and “Similarity Web”
(which offers recommendations to customers who search for products), “Product Tagging” (which can track product popularity and
consumers’ interests), and so on (Chua, 2011). Therefore, compared
to the supplier, the e-tailer possessing more market data and constructing a richer picture of customers’ proﬁles, in general, is more
skilled in predicting market demand.
It is vital for suppliers to strike a trade-off between the potential beneﬁts from oﬄine expansion and the oﬄine entry cost.
Different from Xiao and Inman who seeks oﬄine business, another successful women’s apparel Tao Brand, Hstyle, has no plans
to launch physical stores (CKGSB, 2017). In particular, when the
supplier lacks demand information, she may hesitate to expand
to oﬄine, since she may not know whether the potential beneﬁts
from oﬄine expansion outweighs the oﬄine entry cost. Then the
e-tailer’s information sharing strategy may dramatically affect the
supplier’s oﬄine expansion strategy.
In reality, with the rapid development of information technology, it is more feasible for the retailers to share the demand information credibly with their suppliers. A survey has suggested that
more than 62% of the retailers in the United States reported demand information at least every week with suppliers (Guo, 2009).
In addition, Amazon, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the
world, uses information technology to share information with its
key suppliers (Fawcett, Wallin, & Allred, 2011). While information sharing becomes feasible, one alarm is the e-tailer’s willingness to share the demand information with the supplier, especially in anticipation to the supplier’s oﬄine expansion decision.
From the standpoint of the supplier, the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy can allow her to make oﬄine expansion decisions
more effectively based on the actual market demand. However, for
the e-tailer, information sharing strategy may stimulate the supplier to enter an oﬄine channel after evaluating the beneﬁts and
costs of oﬄine expansion, which can arise channel competition
and may take a toll to the e-tailer. So how will the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy affect the supplier’s oﬄine expansion
strategy? Can the e-tailer deter the supplier from oﬄine entry
through strategically sharing or not sharing information? The main
purpose of this paper is to investigate the e-tailer’s information
sharing strategy in anticipation to the supplier’s oﬄine expansion
decision.
Note that besides the prevailing reselling agreement, recently
e-tailers have started allowing suppliers direct access to their
consumers while charging a fee for providing this access, a format commonly referred to as agency selling (Abhishek, Jerath, &
Zhang, 2016). It should be mentioned that a key difference between agency selling and reselling agreements is who sets the online selling price. Speciﬁcally, under agency selling, the supplier
sets the online selling price whereas it is decided by the e-tailer
under reselling. What are the effects of agency selling or reselling
on the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy when the supplier
has the option to open an oﬄine channel? With the interaction of

135

the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy and the supplier’s oﬄine
expansion decision, what is the e-tailer’s choice, agency selling or
reselling?
Moreover, the interaction of e-tailer’s information sharing strategy and the supplier’s oﬄine entry decision may lead to dualchannel selling (i.e., selling products in both online and oﬄine
channels), which can facilitate two common phenomena about
consumer behavior in multichannel selection: showrooming and
webrooming. Showrooming implies that consumers ﬁrst visit a
physical store to inspect a product but buy it from an online seller,
and webrooming means that consumers ﬁrst assess certain product information online while buy it from a traditional retailer (Jing,
2018). How will showrooming and webrooming affect the e-tailer’s
information sharing strategy and the supplier’s oﬄine expansion
strategy?
Based on the above considerations, this paper contributes to
investigate the e-tailer’s incentives to share demand information
by incorporating supplier’s endogenous oﬄine entry decision under both an agency selling case and a reselling case. To answer
the above questions, we develop a multi-stage game model consisting of one e-tailer (he) and one supplier (she). First, the e-tailer
chooses an agency selling agreement or a reselling agreement. Second, each channel member has two options for their strategic market actions: the e-tailer decides whether to share the demand information, and the supplier decides whether to enter an oﬄine
channel. After the strategic actions, the channel members decide
the selling prices. Employing a game-theoretic approach, we ﬁnd
the following results.
(1) When the supplier’s oﬄine entry cost is very small or large,
the e-tailer shares information under agency selling while keeps
information private under reselling. When the entry cost is intermediate, channel substitution rate is large and information uncertainty is small, the e-tailer may deter the supplier from entering
an oﬄine channel to avoid channel competition through withholding information under agency selling while through sharing information under reselling. The reason lies on the key distinction
between reselling and agency selling: who sets the online selling
price. Under agency selling, the e-tailer should trade off the beneﬁts from more eﬃcient selling prices set by the supplier and the
loss from channel competition due to information sharing. Under
reselling, the e-tailer should balance the beneﬁts from a less aggressive wholesale price and the loss from channel competition
caused by keeping information private.
(2) If the agency fee is quite small or if the agency fee is quite
large and the oﬄine entry cost is small, the e-tailer may choose
reselling, while if the agency fee is intermediate or if the agency
fee is quite large and the oﬄine entry cost is large, the e-tailer
may choose agency selling. As a result, agency selling may lead
to a Pareto improvement under a relatively small agency fee, and
reselling may generate a Pareto improvement under a very large
agency fee and a small supplier’s oﬄine entry cost.
(3) With showrooming or webrooming, the e-tailer’s information sharing decisions are similar to those in the basic case. However, the driver factor of the e-tailer’s preference on information
sharing or not with showrooming is different from that without
showrooming. With consumer showrooming, keeping information
advantages under agency selling and sharing information under reselling may serve as measures to deter supplier oﬄine entry when
the effect of showrooming is weak, while both of them may serve
as tools to encourage supplier oﬄine entry when the effect of
showrooming is strong.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 reviews the literature. In Section 3, a ﬁve-stage game
between an e-tailer and a supplier is formulated where the e-tailer
can choose agency selling or reselling and whether to share the
demand information or not, and the supplier has the option of

136

opening an oﬄine channel. In Sections 4–7, we derive and analyze
the equilibrium strategies. In Section 8, some model extensions
are discussed. Finally, conclusions and future research directions
are made in Section 9.
2. Literature
Literature related to our work can be categorized into the following three streams: supplier’s channel selection strategy, incentives of information sharing and agency selling or reselling.
Researchers have paid great attention to the supplier’s channel
selection strategy in supply chain management, especially to the
supplier’s decision of opening an online direct channel, which
gives rise to channel conﬂict between the supplier and the traditional retailer. This phenomenon is commonly called by “supplier
encroachment”. A great deal of studies have found that supplier
encroachment can alleviate double marginalization, which generates beneﬁts to both the supplier and the retailer. For instance,
Chiang, Chhajed, and Hess (2003) indicate that encroachment can
beneﬁt both players when the customer acceptance of a direct
channel is not too strong. Tsay and Agrawal (2004) ﬁnd that the
additional direct channel of supplier can be beneﬁcial to both
channel members, with the consideration of sales effort. Arya,
Mittendorf, and Sappington (2007) reveal that the retailer can also
beneﬁt from encroachment when the supplier’s cost disadvantage
is large. Li, Gilbert, and Lai (2013, 2015) extend the work of Arya
et al. (2007) to an asymmetric information case where the retailer
knows better about the market demand and show that encroachment may also lead to “lose-lose” and “lose-win” outcomes in
addition to “win-win” and “win-lose” outcomes in the full information setting. In addition, some studies show an opposite result
that encroachment is a hindrance for the retailer. Liu and Zhang
(2006) ﬁnd that the supplier is better off while the retailer is
worse off with supplier encroachment when personalized pricing
is considered. Ha, Long, and Nasiry (2015) demonstrate that encroachment hurts the retailer in a large variety of scenarios with
the consideration of the supplier’s endogenous quality decision.
Matsui (2016) ﬁnds that when facing a dual-channel rival, the
manufacturer may be worse off to adopt dual-channel strategy.
Chen, Liang, Yao, and Sun (2017) show that adding a new channel
can lead to a higher quality and better supply chain performance
by investigating both price and quality decisions. Moreover, several
studies pay attention to the supplier’s endogenous encroachment
decisions. Chun, Rhee, and Park (2011) discuss three types of
channel strategies: online channel only, brick-and-mortar channel
only, and dual channels. Yan, Xiong, and Chu (2018) develop a
two-period model to investigate whether the supplier should
encroach, and ﬁnd that the supplier should encroach when the
durability of the product is very high or very low. Different from
above researches which focus on the supplier’s online channel
selection in addition to the preexisting traditional retail channel, our work study the supplier’s oﬄine entry decision when
she traditionally sell products through an e-tailer in the online
channel. Furthermore, the e-tailer’s information sharing incentives in anticipation to the supplier’s threat to enter an oﬄine
channel are investigated in our paper. We ﬁnd that the e-tailer
is always worse off with supplier oﬄine entry and information
sharing strategy can help him to deter supplier oﬄine entry
successfully.
Related to our paper, several studies focus on the incentives
of information sharing in supply chains. Wang, Lau, and Lau
(2009) take four contract formats into account, i.e., price-only,
franchise fee, two-part tariffs, and menu of contracts, and reveal
that neither of them can stimulate the manufacturer to share its
own production cost information honestly with the dominant retailer. Huang and Yang (2016) also consider the retailer’s contract

design and the supplier’s cost information disclosure decision. The
results show that the supplier is willing to share the production
cost information only when the production cost variance is quite
large. Besides the above studies about the cost information sharing
in supply chains, there are also some researches focusing on the
demand information sharing, like our paper. Li (2002) and Zhang
(2002) indicate that multiple competitive retailers may prefer to
share their demand information with the supplier under a conﬁdential agreement. Ha and Tong (2008) and Ha, Tong, and Zhang
(2011) examine each retailer’s incentives to share demand information with its own supplier in two competing supply chains. Li
and Zhang (2015) ﬁnd that a retailer may be willing to share the
imperfect demand information with the make-to-stock manufacturer. Ha, Tian, and Tong (2017) consider the problem of sharing
demand information in two competing supply chains and investigate production cost reduction as a driver of the incentive for information sharing in a supply chain. Mostly related to our work,
Huang, Guan, and Chen (2018) examine the retailer’s incentives of
sharing the demand information with a supplier with the ability
of encroachment. They point out that the retailer may voluntarily
share the demand information, since it can prevent the supplier
from establishing the direct selling channel. In contrast, we discuss
an e-tailer’s incentives of information sharing with a supplier who
has capacity to enter an oﬄine channel under both agency selling and reselling. Our results show that keeping information private under agency selling and sharing information under reselling
can help the e-tailer to deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine
channel.
Since agency selling is becoming an increasingly popular agreement between the supplier and the e-tailer, the comparison of
agency selling and reselling has spurred active research in platform
retailing. A comprehensive study on the comparison of agency selling and reselling is Abhishek et al. (2016). They develop a theoretical model to answer a key question that when the e-tailers should
use an agency selling format instead of using the more conventional reselling format. Their results show that when sales in the
electronic channel lead to a negative effect on demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer agency selling. Foros, Kind, and
Shaffer (2017) analyze the competitive effects of the agency model
in a market structure with both upstream and downstream competition and multilateral relationships. They ﬁnd that the agency
model is always anticompetitive (leads to higher retail prices)
when it is adopted by the platforms on a market-by-market basis. Tan and Carrillo (2017) analyze a model of digital goods to
compare the agency model with the wholesale model. Their results show that both the revenue-sharing structure and the upstream publisher’s control over the price contribute to the beneﬁts
of the agency model. Zhu and Yao (2018) provide a comparison
between the agency and wholesale models under the electronic
book market duopoly. Motivated by the entry of Apple into the
e-book market with a choice of an agency model, while it faces
the incumbent, Amazon uses a wholesale model, Wirl (2018) explore the existence of such an asymmetric equilibrium that one
retailer chooses the agency model and the other keeps wholesale
pricing. The existence of such an asymmetric equilibrium is conﬁrmed with strong competition upstream. Different from the above
studies, we are devoted to investigate the comparison of agency
selling model and reselling model with both e-tailer’s demand information sharing strategy and supplier’s oﬄine entry decision. We
ﬁnd that agency selling or reselling will signiﬁcantly affect the etailer’s information sharing strategy. Speciﬁcally, the e-tailer may
not share information under agency selling while share information under reselling when the oﬄine entry cost is intermediate,
in order to prevent the supplier from launching an oﬄine channel. In addition, if the agency fee is quite small or if the agency
fee is quite large and the oﬄine entry cost is small, the e-tailer

respectively, where δ ∈ (0, 1) represents the channel substitution
rate1 . Similar demand functions can be seen in Abhishek et al.
(2016); Arya et al. (2007) and Huang et al. (2018).

3. Basic model

3.3. Timeline of the game

3.1. The supplier and the e-tailer

The timeline is shown in Fig. 1. In stage (S1), the e-tailer
chooses an agency selling agreement or a reselling agreement. In
stage (S2), before observing accurate demand information, the etailer ex ante decides whether to share the demand information
(denoted by S) or not (denoted by N). This ex ante setting of information sharing strategy has been widely adopted in the related
literature, such as Arya et al. (2007), Li (2002) and Huang et al.
(2018). In stage (S3), after the demand information is disclosed,
the supplier decides whether to enter an oﬄine channel (E) or not
(Ē ). In stage (S4), if an agency selling agreement is adopted, the
e-tailer offers the supplier an option to engage in online selling
by charging an agency fee α , which is the fraction of the revenue
that he will keep for each unit sold through the marketplace. Here,
we assume an exogenous agency fee applied by the e-tailer because it is generally applied in practice (e.g., by Amazon, Taobao,
JD.com) and is also widely employed in studies on platform pricing, such as Tan and Carrillo (2017) and Zhu and Yao (2018). For
example, Amazon has a 15/85 split for the product categories such
as apparel, fashion and skin care, whereby 85% of the revenue goes
to the upstream supplier and 15% goes to Amazon, e.g., α = 0.15.
If a reselling agreement is adopted, the supplier sets a wholesale
price w to the e-tailer. In stage (S5), under agency selling, the supplier decides the online selling price po , while under reselling, the
e-tailer sets the online selling prices po . In addition, if an oﬄine
channel is opened, the supplier sets the oﬄine selling price pf .
In our basic model, following Huang et al. (2018), we consider
a case that the e-tailer decides an information sharing policy before the supplier determines whether to enter an oﬄine channel.
Further, we also make an extension about the case where the supplier enters an oﬄine channel before the e-tailer determines an
information sharing strategy in Section 8.1.

We consider a supplier and an e-tailer where the supplier sells
products on the online channel through the e-tailer to the end
consumers. The e-tailer can choose a reselling agreement or an
agency selling agreement with the supplier. The supplier can decide whether to establish a brick-and-mortar store, i.e., enter an
oﬄine channel. If she enters an oﬄine channel, in addition to the
preexisting online channel, she can also sell products directly to
consumers through the oﬄine channel; otherwise, she only relies
on the e-tailer to sell products. The supplier incurs a ﬁxed entry
cost F with oﬄine expansion. The prices in the online and oﬄine
channels are denoted as po and pf , respectively.
3.2. Market demand
The total market size is given by a + θ , where a is the base market known to both ﬁrms and θ captures the uncertainty level of
market potential. The e-tailer has more demand information advantages over the supplier due to the rich ﬁrst-hand data and the
more skilled selling experience. Thus, we assume that the e-tailer
can observe the true value of θ , and decide whether to share it
with the supplier, while the supplier only knows the prior distribution of θ , which is assumed to be uniformly distributed in
[− ,  ]. If the supplier does not enter the oﬄine channel, consumer
demand online (qo ) follows a linear, downward-sloping demand
function:

qo = a + θ − po .

(1)

If the supplier enters the oﬄine channel, the two channels engage
in price competition, and we can get the consumer demands in the
oﬄine channel (qf ) and in the online channel (qo ) as

1
qf =
((1 − δ )(a + θ ) − p f + δ po ),
1 − δ2

(2)

1
((1 − δ )(a + θ ) − po + δ p f ),
1 − δ2

(3)

qo =

1
This demand speciﬁcation follows from a quadratic consumption utility of a
representative consumer, which is given by U (qo , q f ) = (qo + q f )(a + θ ) − 12 (q2o +
2
q f + 2δ qo q f ). This is a speciﬁc case of the quadratic utility function in Shubik and
Levitan (1980) and Ingene and Parry (2004). This utility function gives rise to a linear demand structure. Following Singh and Vives (1984), we consider that there is
a continuum of consumers of the same type with a utility function separable and
linear in the good, and the representative consumer maximizes U (qo , q f ) − ( po qo +
p f q f ). As a result, we can get the demand functions as shown in Eqs. (2) and (3).

The basic model is a multistage game, and we aim to ﬁnd the
subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. Solving the game backwards,
we ﬁrst ﬁnd the subgame equilibria of stages (S4) and (S5) for
all possible outcomes of stages (S1) to (S3) (e-tailer’s information sharing strategy and supplier’s oﬄine entry decision under
agency selling and reselling). Then we solve for the equilibrium
of stages (S2) and (S3) based on the subgame equilibria of stages
(S4) and (S5); that is, we derive the equilibrium strategies of the
e-tailer and the supplier about whether to share the information
and whether to enter an oﬄine channel, respectively. Finally, we
obtain the equilibrium selling agreement, i.e., agency selling or reselling in stage (S1).

Note that for either an agency selling agreement or a reselling
agreement, the e-tailer can decide whether to share the demand
information with the supplier in stage (S2), and the supplier can
decide whether to enter an oﬄine channel in stage (S3), which
leads to four possible cases in stages (S4) to (S5): Case SĒ , Case
SE, Case N Ē , and Case NE. For example, Case SĒ implies that the
e-tailer shares demand information and the supplier does not enter an oﬄine channel. In the following, we use superscripts “ ∼ ”

we can get the supplier’s optimal oﬄine entry decision as shown
in Proposition 1.
Proposition 1. Under an agency selling case, the supplier’s optimal
oﬄine entry decision is
(1) given that the e-tailer does not share the demand information,
the supplier enters an oﬄine channel if and only if F ≤ (0);
(2) given that the e-tailer shares the demand information, the supplier always enters an oﬄine channel if F ≤ (− ), never enters if
F > ( ), and enters only when θ > θ˜ if F ∈ ((− ), ( )], where

Proposition 1 indicates that information sharing allows the supplier to make oﬄine expansion decisions more ﬂexibly; that is,
when the e-tailer shares demand information, the supplier’s ofﬂine expansion decision depends on the entry cost F as well as the
disclosed market potential θ . Speciﬁcally, when F ∈ ((− ), ( )],
the supplier will choose to enter an oﬄine channel only if the disclosed market potential is above a threshold, i.e., θ > θ˜ , which we
refer to as a case that the supplier partially enters an oﬄine channel. In fact, the informed supplier can evaluate the beneﬁt of entering an oﬄine channel more effectively. Thus, she may establish
an oﬄine channel when the market potential is large, while only
rely on the online channel when the market potential is small.

Given the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy, the supplier’s
oﬄine entry decision under a reselling case is similar to that under
an agency selling case as shown in Proposition 1. Speciﬁcally, given
that the e-tailer does not share the demand information, the supplier enters an oﬄine channel if and only if the entry cost is small,
i.e., F ≤  (0). Given that the e-tailer shares the demand information, the supplier always enters an oﬄine channel if F ≤ (− ),
never enters if F >  ( ), and partially enters if F ∈ ((− ), ( )].
5.3. The impacts of supplier oﬄine entry on the e-tailer
Proposition 3. With and without information sharing, either the
agency selling e-tailer or the reselling e-tailer is worse off with supplier oﬄine entry.
Proposition 3 indicates that with and without information sharing under a reselling or agency selling case, the e-tailer is always
worse off with supplier oﬄine entry. Oﬄine entry gives rise to
channel competition and thus generates a loss to the e-tailer. In
addition, Fig. 2 shows e-tailer’s expected proﬁts with and without
oﬄine entry under both an agency selling case and a reselling case.
It also indicates that the e-tailer is worse off with supplier oﬄine
entry. Moreover, an interesting result as shown in Fig. 2(a) is that
under both the cases with and without information sharing, the
agency selling e-tailer’s expected proﬁt with supplier oﬄine entry
is non-monotonic in α . Intuitively, a higher agency fee α can help
the e-tailer to gain more proﬁts. However, when the supplier enters an oﬄine channel, a higher agency fee α impels the supplier
to rely more on the proﬁts of the oﬄine channel, which means
that the supplier will signiﬁcantly increase the online selling price
to shift the demand from the online channel to the oﬄine channel.
As a result, the e-tailer suffers from the less online demand under
a higher agency fee α .

entry decision. As a result, the e-tailer prefers to share demand information. Speciﬁcally, sharing demand information can enable the
supplier to tailor the online selling price at a more eﬃcient level
with the disclosed market potential, which beneﬁts the e-tailer. In
other words, under an agency selling case, the e-tailer prefers to
share demand information when the supplier’s oﬄine entry decision is independent of his demand information sharing strategy,
since based on the disclosed market potential, the informed supplier can charge more eﬃcient selling prices.

No matter whether the e-tailer shares demand information or
not, the supplier always enters an oﬄine channel if F ≤ (− ),
and never enters if F > ( ). In other words, the e-tailer’s demand
information sharing strategy does not affect the supplier’s oﬄine

Proposition 4 indicates that the e-tailer prefers to keep the demand information private if the channel substitution rate is large,
i.e., δ > δ˜ and the supplier’s oﬄine entry cost is intermediate, i.e.,
F ∈ ((0 ), F˜ ∗ ). As stated above, sharing demand information under an agency selling case can allow the supplier to charge more
eﬃcient selling prices, which beneﬁts the e-tailer. When the supplier’s oﬄine entry decision is not affected by the e-tailer’s sharing
strategy, such beneﬁts of information sharing dominate. However,
anticipating a possible threat that the supplier may enter an ofﬂine channel and compete with the online channel under information sharing, the e-tailer will rethink his information sharing
strategy. Disclosing demand information endows the supplier with
more ﬂexibility for making oﬄine entry decision. Given an intermediate entry cost F ∈ ((0 ), F˜ ∗ ), the supplier does not enter an
oﬄine channel without information sharing while she partially enters with information sharing as indicated in Proposition 1; that is,
sharing demand information encourages the supplier to establish
an oﬄine channel. Thus, the e-tailer should trade off between the
beneﬁts from more eﬃcient selling prices and the loss from channel competition due to information sharing. Speciﬁcally, when the
channel substitution rate δ is small (channel competition is weak),
the e-tailer is better off with information sharing since he enjoys
more eﬃcient selling prices, even though the supplier enters an
oﬄine channel. However, when the channel substitution rate δ is
large, i.e., δ > δ˜ , the e-tailer prefers to withhold demand information to deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel.
To further illustrate the above result that withholding demand
information can help the agency selling e-tailer to deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel, we employ a numerical study with basic parameters: a = 1, δ = 0.2, α = 0.5,  = 0.2
(these basic parameters are used throughout our paper if no otherwise speciﬁed). Fig. 3 shows the e-tailer’s expected payoffs with
and without information sharing under agency selling. As shown in
Fig. 3(a), the e-tailer is better off with demand information sharing
when δ is relatively small, i.e., δ = 0.02. However, when δ is quite
larger, i.e., δ = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 3(b), the e-tailer prefers not to
share demand information if F ∈ (0.136, 0.194), where the supplier
partially enters an oﬄine channel under information sharing while
never enters under no information sharing. For the agency selling
e-tailer, withholding demand information can serve as an effective
deterrence on the supplier from entering oﬄine channel and thus
to avoid channel competition.

Lemma 2. Under a reselling case, when the oﬄine entry cost F ≤
(− ) or F >  ( ), the e-tailer prefers not to share demand information.

According to Lemma 2, when the oﬄine entry cost is suﬃciently small or very large (F ≤ (− ) or F >  ( )), where the
supplier’s oﬄine expansion is independent of the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy, the e-tailer prefers not to share demand
information. This is different from the result under an agency selling case (as shown in Lemma 1) that when the oﬄine entry cost
is suﬃciently small or very large, the e-tailer prefers to share demand information. The basic reason is that the online selling pricesetting power belongs to different players under a reselling case
and an agency selling case. Speciﬁcally, under an agency selling
case where the supplier has the pricing power, sharing demand information with the supplier is beneﬁcial to the e-tailer because it
can allow the supplier to tailor the online selling price at a more
eﬃcient level. However, under a reselling case where the e-tailer
has pricing power, sharing demand information will hurt the etailer. The reason is that as the e-tailer himself sets the online
selling price, the main factor to inﬂuence the e-tailer’s information
sharing decision-making will be how the supplier’s wholesale price
decision is affected by the information sharing strategy. Withholding the demand information can mislead the supplier to make ineﬃcient wholesale pricing decision. As a result, a reselling e-tailer
beneﬁts from a less aggressive wholesale price set by the supplier
when he keeps demand information advantages.
Proposition 5. Under a reselling case, the e-tailer shares information if and only if δ > δˆ and F ∈ (Fˆ ∗ , (0 )). Here, δˆ ∈ (0, 1 ) and
Fˆ ∗ ∈ ((− ), (0 )) are shown in Appendix A.
Given entry cost F ∈ (Fˆ ∗ , (0 )), the supplier always enters an
oﬄine channel without information sharing while she partially enters with information sharing; that is, information sharing can deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel and thus help the
e-tailer to avoid channel competition. The e-tailer should strike a
balance between the beneﬁts from avoiding channel competition
and the loss from a more aggressive wholesale price due to information sharing. Speciﬁcally, when the channel substitution rate
is large, i.e., δ > δˆ , the e-tailer is willing to share information to
avoid intense competition; otherwise, the e-tailer prefers to keep
information advantages. It should be mentioned that a signiﬁcant
difference between the result under a reselling case and that under an agency selling case is that the e-tailer can effectively deter
the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel through sharing information under a reselling case, but through withholding demand
information under an agency selling case.
In sum, when F is very small or large, the e-tailer prefers
to share information under an agency selling case while prefers
not to share information under a reselling case. When F is intermediate and δ is large, the e-tailer deters the supplier from

entering an oﬄine channel with sharing information under a reselling case, but with keeping information private under an agency
selling case.

without information sharing. Fig. 4(a) indicates that the e-tailer
is worse off with demand information sharing when δ is very

small, i.e., δ = 0.02. However, when δ is large, i.e., δ = 0.5 as shown
in Fig. 4(b), the e-tailer is willing to share demand information
if F ∈ (0.109, 0.165), where the supplier partially enters an oﬄine
channel under information sharing while always enters under no
information sharing. For the reselling e-tailer, sharing demand information can help him to deter the supplier from entering oﬄine
channel and thus to avoid channel competition.
6.3. Information sharing vs. no sharing
As shown in Propositions 4 and 5, the e-tailer’s equilibrium
information sharing decisions are different under agency selling
and reselling. To further illustrate the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy, we employ a numerical study with respect to related
parameters in Figs. 5 and 6.
Speciﬁcally, we can get the following comments. (1) When the
channel substitution rate δ is quite small, i.e., channel competition

is very weak, the e-tailer does not has incentives to deter supplier
oﬄine entry. Thus, the e-tailer prefers to share information under agency selling and to keep information private under reselling.
When the channel substitution rate δ is relatively large, i.e., channel competition is relatively strong, the e-tailer should deter the
supplier from entering an oﬄine channel. If F is suﬃciently small
or large, the supplier’s oﬄine entry decision is independent of the
e-tailer’s information sharing strategy, thus the agency selling etailer is willing to share demand information, whereas the reselling
e-tailer prefers to keep demand information private. If F is intermediate, the agency selling e-tailer prefers not to share demand
information while the reselling e-tailer prefers to share information to deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel and
thus to avoid competition. The above results are in line with those
shown in Propositions 4 and 5. (2) When the information uncertainty  is relatively large, under an agency selling case, the expected revenue from more eﬃcient selling prices with information

sharing becomes remarkable, thus the e-tailer prefers to share information. However, under reselling, a relatively large  means that
the e-tailer has more information advantages, thus he has more incentives to keep information private and misleads the supplier to
set a less aggressive wholesale price. Only if  is small and F is
intermediate where the loss from channel competition outweighs
the beneﬁt from more eﬃcient selling prices due to information
sharing, the agency selling e-tailer prefers to withhold demand information. For the reselling e-tailer, he is willing to share demand
information if  is small and F is intermediate since the loss from
channel competition outweighs the beneﬁt from a less aggressive
wholesale price due to keep information private.
Furthermore, Fig. 7 indicates the zones where the e-tailer deters
the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel under both agency
selling and reselling. In these dotted zones shown in Fig. 7, where
δ is large,  is small and F is intermediate, the e-tailer prevents
the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel through withholding
information under agency selling and through sharing information
under reselling.

6.4. Equilibrium proﬁts
Combining the above analysis, we further investigate the proﬁts
for the e-tailer, the supplier, and the total supply chain with equilibrium information sharing and oﬄine entry strategies as shown
in Fig. 8, in which {A, B} represents that the equilibrium strategies of the e-tailer and the supplier respectively are A and B where
A ∈ {S, N} and B ∈ {E , P E , Ē }. For example, {S, PE} indicates that at
equilibrium the e-tailer shares the demand information and the
supplier partially enters an oﬄine channel.
Fig. 8 shows that the equilibrium information sharing and ofﬂine entry strategies are quite different between the agency selling
and reselling contracts. Speciﬁcally, under agency selling, with F increasing, the equilibrium strategy combination changes from {S, E}
to {S, PE}, and to {N, Ē }, and again to {S, PE}, and ﬁnally to {S, Ē }.
However, under reselling, as F increases, the equilibrium strategy
combination changes from {N, E} to {S, PE}, and to {N, Ē }. Note
that as stated above, when the equilibrium strategy combination
is {N, Ē } under agency selling or it is {S, PE} under reselling, the

e-tailer can deter the supplier from opening an oﬄine channel via
the information sharing strategy.
7. Stage (S1): agency selling vs. reselling
Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we employ a
numerical study to examine the impacts of of agency selling or reselling on the equilibrium proﬁts of chain members. We show the
e-tailer’s and the supplier’s equilibrium proﬁts under agency selling and reselling in Fig. 9.
According to Fig. 9(b), the supplier’s equilibrium proﬁt under an agency selling case decreases with α . In addition, under
a relatively small agency fee α (α = 0.1 and α = 0.3), the supplier prefers an agency selling case, while under a relatively large

agency fee α (α = 0.6 and α = 0.88), the supplier prefers a reselling case. The above result is intuitive that the supplier tends to
a reselling case with a larger agency fee α . Correspondingly, one
may conclude that the e-tailer prefers a reselling case when α is
small and prefers an agency selling case when α is large. However,
Fig. 9(a) demonstrates that when α is quite small (α = 0.1), the etailer prefers reselling, and when α is intermediate (α = 0.3 and
α = 0.6), the e-tailer gets more proﬁts under agency selling, and
when α is relatively large (α = 0.88), the e-tailer prefers agency
selling when F is large and prefers reselling when F is small. Under
a quite small agency fee α , the e-tailer chooses reselling due to the
low proﬁt margin under agency selling. When α is intermediate,
the e-tailer adopts agency selling, since the double marginalization
effect under reselling gives rise to a loss on the e-tailer. In addition,

146

Fig. 10. The timeline of the alternative scenario.

when α is relatively large, under a small F where the supplier has
more incentives to enter an oﬄine channel, the e-tailer chooses reselling, since most demand is shifted from online to oﬄine by the
supplier under agency selling. When F is large and the supplier
tends to sell products only through the online channel, the e-tailer
enjoys the beneﬁts from high agency fee α under agency selling
where double marginalization does not occur.
In sum, we can get the e-tailer’s choice of selling agreement in
Stage (S1) depends on both the agency fee α and the oﬄine entry
cost F. If the agency fee α is quite small or if α is quite large and
the oﬄine entry cost F is small, the e-tailer may choose reselling,
while if α is intermediate or if α is quite large and F is large, the
e-tailer may choose agency selling.
Moreover, under a relatively small agency fee (e.g., α = 0.3),
both the supplier and the e-tailer prefer agency selling, whereas
under a very large agency fee (e.g., α = 0.88), both of them prefer
reselling when F is small. In other words, for the channel members,
agency selling may lead to a Pareto improvement under a relatively
small agency fee, and reselling may generate a Pareto improvement
under a relatively large agency fee when the supplier’s oﬄine entry cost is small.

Proposition 6 indicates that under agency selling, for the supplier, the alternative timing of supplier oﬄine expansion (i.e., supplier’s oﬄine expansion decision before the e-tailer’s information
sharing strategy) is superior to the timing in the basic model (i.e.,
supplier’s oﬄine expansion decision after the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy) only if the entry cost F is intermediate (i.e.,
F ∈ ((0), ( )]) and the channel competition is relatively strong
(δ > δ˜ ). For the e-tailer, the alternative timing of supplier oﬄine
expansion is superior to the timing in the basic model only if the



entry cost F is intermediate (i.e., F ∈ (

Proposition 7. Under a reselling case, the timing of supplier oﬄine
expansion in the basic model is always weakly superior to the alternative timing for both the chain members.
Proposition 7 highlights the value of delaying supplier oﬄine
expansion under a reselling case, which can lead to a “win–win”
outcome for both the chain members.
In sum, we can ﬁnd that the timing of supplier oﬄine expansion in our basic model can lead to higher payoffs for both ﬁrms
under a reselling case and when the entry cost is very low or high
under an agency selling case.

8.1. Alternative timing of supplier oﬄine expansion
8.2. Asymmetric oﬄine expansion cost information
In the basic model, we assume that the supplier opens a direct
channel after the e-tailer shares the demand information, in which
the timing of establishing a direct channel is similar to Huang et al.
(2018). However, there may also exist other possible timings for
supplier oﬄine expansion; that is, the supplier enters an oﬄine
channel before the e-tailer shares the demand information. In this
subsection, we examine an alternative scenario where the supplier
decides whether to enter an oﬄine channel before the e-tailer determines whether to share the demand information. The timeline
of the alternative scenario is shown in Fig. 10. In the following, we
consider the equilibrium results under agency selling and reselling,
respectively.
Proposition 6. Under an agency selling case,
(1) for the supplier, the alternative timing of supplier oﬄine expansion is superior to the timing in the basic model only if F ∈ ((0),
( )] and δ > δ˜ ;

In this subsection, we consider a case where the e-tailer does
not exactly know the supplier’s oﬄine entry cost F, and only holds
a prior information distribution of F with mean μ and variance σ 2 .
It is obvious that given the e-tailer’s information sharing strategy,
the supplier’s oﬄine entry strategies under asymmetric cost information are the same as those under full information, which can be
seen in Propositions 1 and 2. Correspondingly, the equilibrium information sharing strategies of the e-tailer under both agency selling and reselling are shown in Proposition 8.
Proposition 8. Under agency selling, the e-tailer does not share information if and only if δ > δ˜ and μ ∈ ((0 ), F˜ ∗ ), while under reselling, the e-tailer shares information if and only if δ > δˆ and μ ∈
(Fˆ ∗ , (0 )).
Proposition 8 indicates that our main results qualitatively hold
in the asymmetric entry cost information case. Speciﬁcally, when

the e-tailer’s estimation on the supplier’s oﬄine entry cost, i.e.,
μ, is very small or large, the e-tailer shares information under
agency selling while keeps information private under reselling.
When μ is intermediate, and channel substitution rate is large,
the e-tailer withholds the demand information under agency selling while shares information under reselling to deter the supplier
from entering an oﬄine channel.
8.3. Consumer showrooming
In the basic model, we only consider that the channel members make pricing decisions. In practice, the supplier who opens
a brick-and-mortar store may put efforts to showcase the product
to the consumer. Then a quite prevalent phenomenon may happen
that consumers gather information about a product from the ofﬂine store and then purchase the product online, which is referred
to as “showrooming” (Mehra, Kumar, & Raju, 2017; Rapp, Baker, &
Bachrach, 2015). If the supplier does not enter the oﬄine channel,
consumer demand online is the same as the basic model shown
in Eq. (1). If the supplier enters the oﬄine channel, she can invest
in sales effort to promote the consumers’ understanding about the
product and thus to improve sales when selling products through a
brick-and-mortar store. For a given level of sales effort s, the supplier incurs a cost

C (s ) =

s2
.
2

(58)

With consumer showrooming, the consumer demands in the ofﬂine channel and in the online channel are given by:

qCS
f =

(1 − δ )(a + θ ) − p f + δ po
+ (1 − τ )s,
1 − δ2

(59)

qCS
o =

(1 − δ )(a + θ ) − po + δ p f
+ τ s,
1 − δ2

(60)

respectively, where superscript “CS” represents the case with consumer showrooming. In addition, τ ∈ [0, 1) is the proportion of the
increase in demand due to supplier’s sales effort that shifts to the
online channel and this is the effect of consumer showrooming.
Therefore, as τ increases, the effect of showrooming increases. In

other words, τ is the measure of the intensity of showrooming in a
market. An extreme case is that when τ = 0, consumer showrooming does not occur. Similar description of consumer showrooming
can also be seen in Basak, Basu, and Avittathur (2017). The timeline in this case is as follows: Stages (S1) to (S4) are the same as
those in the basic model; in stage (S5), the supplier (the e-tailer)
sets the online selling price po under agency selling (reselling), and
if she decides to enter an oﬄine channel, she also sets the oﬄine
selling price pf and sales effort s. The detailed solving process is
shown in Appendix B.
Taking consumer showrooming into consideration, Figs. 11 and
12 indicate the e-tailer’s expected proﬁts with and without information sharing under an agency selling case and a reselling case,
respectively. An obvious difference between the results with and
without consumer showrooming is that the e-tailer may be better
off with supplier oﬄine entry when considering consumer showrooming, while he is always worse off without showrooming as
shown in Proposition 3. Speciﬁcally, the e-tailer’s expected proﬁt
increases with F (he is worse off with supplier oﬄine entry) when
τ is small, while it decreases with F (he is better off with supplier oﬄine entry) when τ is large under both agency selling and
reselling. When the supplier enters an oﬄine channel, consumer
showrooming allows consumers to get information oﬄine but buy
online, which brings additional online revenues and beneﬁts the
e-tailer. Thus, when τ is small, the beneﬁt from showrooming is
dominated by the loss from channel competition due to supplier
oﬄine entry, and oﬄine entry hurts the e-tailer; oppositely, when
τ is large, the beneﬁt from showrooming outweighs the loss from
channel competition, and oﬄine entry beneﬁts the e-tailer.
In addition, the e-tailer’s information sharing decision with respect to F with showrooming is similar to that without showrooming. Speciﬁcally, under an agency selling case, the e-tailer prefers
to share information when F is very small or large, while prefers
not to share information when F is intermediate. Under a reselling
case, the e-tailer withholds information when F is very small or
large, while is willing to share information when F is intermediate. However, the driver factor of the e-tailer’s preference on information sharing or not with showrooming is different from that
without showrooming. In the basic case without showrooming, the
e-tailer keeps information private under agency selling, and shares

information under reselling to deter the supplier from oﬄine entry.
In the case with showrooming, the e-tailer withholds information
under agency selling, and discloses information under reselling to
deter the supplier from oﬄine entry when τ is small, while he
wants to stimulates the supplier to enter an oﬄine channel when
τ is large. The reason has stated above that the e-tailer is worse
off with oﬄine entry when τ is small while he is better off when
τ is large. Speciﬁcally, the supplier enters an oﬄine channel without information sharing while she partially enters with information sharing, and the agency selling e-tailer prefers not to share
information to encourage oﬄine entry when F ∈ (0.174, 0.255) and
τ = 0.75. For the reselling case, given that F ∈ (0.265, 0.377) and
τ = 0.75, the supplier does not enter an oﬄine channel without
information sharing while she partially enters with information
sharing, and the e-tailer prefers to share information to encourage
oﬄine entry.

Fig. 13 shows e-tailer’s preference on information sharing with
respect to τ . The e-tailer prefers not to share information under
agency selling, while prefers to share information under reselling,
only if τ is suﬃciently small or large and F is intermediate. The
e-tailer keeps information advantages under agency selling and
shares information under reselling to deter supplier from oﬄine
entry when τ is very small, and to encourage the supplier to enter
an oﬄine channel when τ is quite large. When τ is intermediate,
an agency selling e-tailer always prefers to share information and
a reselling e-tailer always prefers to withhold information.
8.4. Consumer webrooming
In this subsection, we consider another extension of the basic
model that the e-tailer puts sales efforts on online selling to attract
consumers, which leads to a phenomenon called by “webroom-

effort is denoted by v, and he incurs a cost v2 . If the supplier does
not enter the oﬄine channel, consumer demand online is

where superscript “CW” represents the case with consumer webrooming. If the supplier enters the oﬄine channel, the consumer
demands in the oﬄine channel and in the online channel are given
by

qCW

respectively, where η ∈ (0, 1) is a measure of the intensity of webrooming in a market. Therefore, as η increases, the effect of weqCW

brooming increases. The timeline in this case is as follows: stages
(S1)–(S4) are the same as those in the basic model; in stage (S5),
the supplier (the e-tailer) sets the online selling price po under
agency selling (reselling), and the e-tailer sets the sales effort v,
and if the supplier decides to enter an oﬄine channel, she also sets
the oﬄine selling price pf . The detailed solving process is shown in
Appendix C.
According to Figs. 14 and 15, we can get the e-tailer’s information sharing decisions with consumer webrooming, which are sim-

150

ilar to those in the basic case without webrooming. Speciﬁcally,
under an agency selling case, the e-tailer does not share information only when F is intermediate. Under a reselling case, the etailer is willing to share information only when F is intermediate.
Both withholding information under agency selling and sharing information under reselling can serve as effective measures for the
e-tailer to deter supplier from oﬄine entry.
9. Conclusion
In this paper, we consider a supply chain where the e-tailer can
choose whether to share the demand information, and the supplier
can decide whether to open a direct oﬄine channel by incorporating both agency selling and reselling formats. The equilibrium information sharing strategy of the e-tailer and oﬄine entry decision
of the supplier are derived under both agency selling and reselling
to investigate the e-tailer’s information sharing incentives in anticipation of supplier oﬄine entry. The supplier’s and e-tailer’s equilibrium proﬁts are compared under the two formats to discuss the
chain members’ preferences on agency selling or reselling. In addition, we make several extensions to further explore the interaction
of e-tailer information sharing and supplier oﬄine entry with consumer showrooming and webrooming.
Our results are concluded as follows. (1) When the supplier’s
oﬄine entry cost is very small or large, the e-tailer shares the demand information under agency selling while does not share information under reselling. When the entry cost is intermediate, channel substitution rate is large and information uncertainty is small,
the e-tailer keeps information private under agency selling while
shares information under reselling to deter the supplier from entering an oﬄine channel and further to avoid channel competition.
In fact, under agency selling, the e-tailer should strike a balance
between the beneﬁts from more eﬃcient selling prices set by the
supplier and the loss from channel competition due to information
sharing. Under reselling, the e-tailer should trade off the beneﬁts
from a less aggressive wholesale price and the loss from channel competition caused by keeping information private. (2) If the
agency fee is quite small or if the agency fee is quite large and
the oﬄine entry cost is small, the e-tailer prefers reselling, while
if the agency fee is intermediate or if the agency fee is quite large
and the oﬄine entry cost is large, the e-tailer prefers agency selling. (3) With showrooming or webrooming, the e-tailer’s information sharing decisions are similar to those in the basic case. However, the driver factor of the e-tailer’s preference on information
sharing or not with showrooming is different from that without
showrooming. With consumer showrooming, keeping information
advantages under agency selling and sharing information under reselling may help the e-tailer to deter supplier oﬄine entry when
the effect of showrooming is weak, while both of them may allow
the e-tailer to encourage supplier oﬄine entry when the effect of
showrooming is strong.
Despite the importance of the managerial insights for e-tailer
information sharing and supplier oﬄine entry under both agency
selling and reselling, our study also has a few limitations. In our
paper, we consider that the supplier opens physical stores directly
if she chooses to enter an oﬄine channel, rather than selling products via retail stores. Future direction can be pointed at an indirect
oﬄine expansion case where the supplier enters an oﬄine channel via a traditional retailer. Note that the traditional retailer may
share demand information with the supplier to encourage the supplier to enter an oﬄine channel, whereas the e-tailer wants to use
the information sharing strategy to deter the supplier from oﬄine
expansion. It means the incentives of the e-tailer and the traditional retailer to share the information are completely opposite.
In addition, information sharing may give rise to not only changes
in strategy for the players involved in the information interchange

(direct effect) but also changes in strategy for the other competing
retailer (indirect effect).
