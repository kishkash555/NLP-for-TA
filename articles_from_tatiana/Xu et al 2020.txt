Coordination

This paper investigates the coordination problem of a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer
and a retailer who sells products through an offline channel and an online platform. Platform
power is considered to reflect the ability of the platform to enlarge the market share. We find that
the supply chain can be coordinated via wholesale price and cost-sharing contracts when platform power is large, and even if platform power is small, the supply chain can still be coordinated
via cost-sharing contract when delivery time sensitivity is relatively high. Most of the results are
robust when the manufacturer joins the platform.

1. Introduction
In recent years, many offline retailers open online selling channels at online platforms via marketplace mode to enlarge the
market size (Zhang et al, 2016; Choi et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). An online platform operating with marketplace
mode (such as Tmall.com in China, Flipkart in India and Amazon.com in US) allows retailers to sell their products to consumers on
the platform, and charges the retailers a commission for each product sold through the platform (Abhishek et al., 2016; Yan et al.,
2018; Shen, 2018; Lin and Zhou, 2019). The commission is usually in the form of a percentage of the retailer’s online sales through
the platform. Suning Group, the second largest retailer in China, opens its new online channel at Tmall.com (i.e., the Suning flagship
store on Tmall.com) in 2015, besides its own online and offline channels (He et al., 2019). Only three years later, it is reported that on
the “double eleven” shopping day of 2018, the sales of Suning flagship store on Tmall.com is the largest one among all the retailers on
Tmall.com.1 Other retailers, such as RT-mart and Costco, have also achieved great success through similar cooperation with
Tmall.com. This indicates that the online platform can bring a new potential market for the retailers (Shen et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019;
Liu et al., 2019). For ease of exposition, we use the new potential market size to measure the power of the online platform on
enlarging a retailer’s market, and simply call it “platform power”. In order to facilitate the integration of offline channel and online
channel, these retailers usually set the same retail price on the two channels (Li et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2017; Gao and Su, 2017a, 2017b;
Zhang et al., 2019).
With the prevalence of online shopping, consumers are more and more sensitive to the delivery time (Xiao et al., 2016; Pekgün
et al., 2017; Ding et al., 2018). According to a survey conducted by Dotcom Distribution, 87% of consumers consider delivery time to
be a key factor when purchasing products from online channel. Furthermore, 67% of them are willing to pay more for the products

with shorter delivery time (Modak and Kelle, 2019; Niu et al., 2019). As the second largest retailer in China, Suning Group has built
its own logistics system. To enhance the new online market, Suning Group invests more on the logistics service. Suning Group merges
Tiantian Express and establishes several distribution centers to support daily shipping volume of 70,000 votes on average. When
consumers buy products from Suning flagship store on Tmall.com, they can get their products within two hours, even less than five
minutes. This logistics service with very short delivery time is called “Jisuda”.
Due to double marginalization, decentralized supply chain is inefficient compared to centralized supply chain. That’s the motivation of investigating various supply chain coordination problems by numerous scholars (Cachon, 2003; He et al., 2009; Xu et al.,
2017a; Ji et al., 2020). Many types of contracts are designed by scholars and practitioners, aiming to achieve supply chain coordination. Among the various contracts, wholesale price contract and cost-sharing contract are two most popular ones (Cachon,
2003; Xu et al., 2017a; Ji et al., 2020). With wholesale price contract, the manufacturer charges the retailer with a fixed wholesale
price for each product (Xu et al., 2017b). Although this contract usually cannot coordinate simple supply chains (Cachon, 2003), it is
widely used in reality due to its simplicity to implement. With cost-sharing contract, the firm who benefits from the other firm’s
investment should undertake a certain part of that firm’s investment cost (Zhou et al., 2018).
Cost-sharing contract has been widely used in reality (Xu et al., 2017a). In the aforementioned supply chain structure, the retailer
(such as Suning Group) makes huge investment on logistics service to compress the delivery time. The online platform (such as
Tmall.com) who retains the commission from the retailer’s sales, however, has negligible marginal cost with increasing sales. This
leads to the motivation of the platform to share a part of the retailer’s cost on logistics investment, in order to further increase the
retailer’s sales and thus its own revenue. For example, besides its own sales, Suning Group also provides logistics service for products
sold from “Tmall Supermarket” and other retailers on Tmall.com. Alibaba Group, who is the owner of Tmall.com, supports the
logistics development of Suning Group by offering Big Data and Cloud Computing services. Alibaba Group invests 28.3 billion RMB,
holding for 19.99% stake in Suning Group.2 Similar cases can be found in the cooperation of Alibaba Group and Watsons which is the
sixth largest retailer in China.
We can formulate the aforementioned context as the following supply chain structure: a manufacturer wholesales products to a
retailer, who then sells products through its own offline channel and an online channel via a platform. The supply chain coordination
problem in this structure has some special features. First, the involvement of platform makes the commission rate and platform power
two factors to be considered in the coordination problem. Second, the delivery time is a critical decision in this supply chain, thus the
consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time may play an important role in the supply chain coordination problem. To the best of our
knowledge, there are no studies investigating supply chain coordination in the presence of the platform power and an online platform
operating with marketplace mode. Our research aims to fill this gap by addressing the following questions.
(1) How do the platform’s commission rate and platform power affect the operational decisions of the members and supply chain
coordination?
(2) How does the consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time affect the operational decisions of the members and supply chain coordination?
(3) Can wholesale price and delivery cost-sharing contracts coordinate the supply chain?
Motivated by the operational practice of platform economics, we in this paper study a new type of supply chain coordination
problem considering an online platform. Specifically, we investigate the optimal wholesale price of the manufacturer, the optimal
retail price and delivery time of the retailer, and examine whether the wholesale price and delivery cost-sharing contracts can
coordinate this supply chain. To examine the robustness of our results, we also extend the model to the case that the manufacturer
rather than the retailer opens a direct online sales channel on the platform, and investigate the supply chain coordination problem of
this new supply chain with the two contracts. Furthermore, we conduct a set of numerical studies based on real data to verify the
analytical results.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and positions this research. Section 3
presents the problem formulation and some basic assumptions. In Section 4, by building and solving Stackelberg game models, we
investigate the operational decisions of the supply chain members, based on which we examine the effects of wholesale price and
delivery cost-sharing contracts on coordinating the supply chain. In Section 5, we conduct a set of numerical studies based on real
data. Section 6 concludes this paper and puts forward some future research directions. All the proofs for the theorems and propositions are shown in Appendix.
2. Literature review
Our work builds on contribution in three streams. The first one is the research on the operational decisions with a marketplace
platform. The second one is the research on contract-based coordination with delivery time decision. The last one is the research on
dual-channel supply chain coordination with wholesale price and cost-sharing contracts.

2.1. The operational decisions with a marketplace platform
In recent years, more and more attentions have been paid to the operational decisions with a marketplace platform. Hagiu and
Wright (2014), Tian et al. (2018) and Geng et al. (2018) are a few representatives. Here we mainly review the studies related to the
interaction of offline channel and online channel, which can be further divided into two aspects. One considers the competition
between the two channels and the other considers the influence of online demand on the offline demand.
Some studies investigate the competition between an offline channel and an online channel, where the online channel operates
with marketplace mode. Tan and Carrillo (2017) explore the optimal retail price of offline channel and online channel where a
publisher sells its products to retailers through the two channels. They find that, to let the publisher set the retail price can benefit all
the supply chain members. Wang et al. (2018) analyze a manufacturer’s choice between establishing a direct channel and joining an
online platform. They suggest that the manufacturer will join the platform when the commission rate is low. Considering green
technology investment of a platform, Wang et al. (2020) investigate the joint production and pricing decisions of a supplier who sells
products through an offline channel and an online platform. They show that the platform’s green technology investment may damage
the supplier’s profit. Shen et al. (2019) analyze the production and pricing decisions of a manufacturer by considering the competition of an offline channel and an online channel provided by a platform. They find that the online platform and the manufacturer
can achieve a win-win result under certain situations.
Our work differs from the aforementioned papers in that none of them but ours considers the delivery time decision and supply
chain coordination issue. Our work is closely related to Shen et al. (2019). Shen et al. (2019) mainly explore the channel selection and
pricing decisions of a manufacturer who sells its products through an online platform and a traditional retailer. In their work, the
impact of platform power (called potential market size there) on pricing decisions is also considered. Our work differs from Shen et al.
(2019) in three aspects. First, we consider the delivery time decision in our model, and find that consumers’ sensitivity can significantly affect the firms’ optimal decisions and the supply chain coordination. Second, besides wholesale price contract, we also
consider delivery cost-sharing contract in the supply chain coordination issue. Lastly, we assume the retail price on the offline
channel is the same as that on the online channel, which is a current trend in such a supply chain structure.
The second aspect considers the influence of online demand on the offline demand. Abhishek et al. (2016) explore the pricing
decisions of a manufacturer who may join a marketplace platform or a reselling platform. They consider the influence of online sales
on the offline sales and find that the manufacturer prefers the marketplace mode when this influence is negative. Yan et al. (2018)
explore the pricing decisions of a manufacturer who sells products through an online platform with marketplace mode. They find that
the manufacturer and the platform can achieve Pareto improvement when the influence of online channel on the offline channel is
moderate. Chen et al. (2018) analyze the impacts of an additional online channel on the operational decisions of a supply chain in the
presence of spillover effect from the online channel to the offline channel. They discover that, the manufacturer and the retailer can
achieve a win-win result when the spillover effect is moderate. The above studies all assume that the retail price of offline channel is
fixed. But we regard the retail price of offline channel to be a decision variable in this work. Moreover, we consider the platform
power to be a factor in this work and analyze its impact on supply chain coordination with wholesale price and delivery cost-sharing
contracts. We find that the platform power can significantly affect the supply chain coordination results.
2.2. Contract-based coordination with delivery time decisions
Many papers study the contract-based coordination issue with delivery time decision, such as Hua et al. (2010), Afèche et al.
(2013) and Pekgün et al. (2017). Here, we mainly review the studies closely related to our work.
Xiao and Qi (2016) study the pricing, delivery time and delivery reliability decisions with a quantity discount contract in a twostage supply chain. They find that the quantity discount contract can coordinate the supply chain. Hafızoğlu et al. (2016) analyze the
pricing and delivery time decisions where consumers are contracted in two classes: (1) purchasing the product before a selling time;
(2) purchasing the product during a selling time with a dynamic pricing. They show that the contract design is significantly affected
by the price or consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time. Dai et al. (2016) discuss the design of supply chain contract with uncertain
demand. They consider two contracts: (1) the delivery-time-dependent quantity flexibility contract and (2) late rebate contract. They
find that the two contracts cannot coordinate the supply chain. Liu et al. (2016) investigate whether an option contract can coordinate the supply chain with demand uncertainty. The uncertainty lies in the demand of the retailer, who relies on an express
delivery provider to provide delivery service. They find that this option contract can coordinate the supply chain. Ding et al. (2018)
study the pricing and service time decisions of two substitutable products under a carbon tax regulation. They find that, the intense
competition of prices can induce the less service time. Modak and Kelle (2019) consider a dual-channel supply chain where a
manufacturer sells products through an online platform and a traditional retailer. Consumers are sensitive to the retail price and
delivery time. They find that, a quantity discount with a franchise fee contract can coordinate the supply chain.
The above studies explore the contract-based coordination issue with delivery time decisions, and some of them are in a dualchannel structure. The dual-channel structure is usually established by the manufacturer, which has essential difference compared to
an online platform. In our work, when the retailer opens an online channel on a platform, two factors directly affect the retailer’s
operational decisions and the supply chain coordination. One is the platform power, and the other is the platform’s commission rate.
2.3. The dual-channel supply chain coordination with wholesale price and cost-sharing contracts
There are many studies investigating supply chain coordination in traditional channel situation with different contracts, such as

X. Xu, et al.

Ma et al. (2013), Xu et al. (2017a) and Yang and Chen (2018). Here we mainly review the articles on supply chain coordination in
dual-channel situation with wholesale price and cost-sharing contracts.
Chen et al. (2012) consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer sells products through
the retailer and a direct channel. They explore the supply chain coordination problem with wholesale price contract, and find that
wholesale price contract can coordinate the supply chain in some cases. Zhang et al. (2015) consider the demand and production cost
disruptions, and discover that a wholesale price contract with a lump sum fee can coordinate the supply chain. Li et al. (2016)
consider a risk-averse retailer and a risk-neutral supplier with uncertain demand. They show that wholesale price contract cannot
coordinate the supply chain. None of the aforementioned papers consider the delivery time decision in their models. Moreover, our
work considers an online platform who charges a commission from and brings new potential market to the retailer. Furthermore, the
above studies focus on wholesale price contract while we also explore the delivery cost-sharing contract, where the platform and the
retailer can share the cost of compressing the delivery time.
There are also some studies exploring the dual-channel supply chain coordination with cost-sharing contract. Zha et al. (2015)
investigate a dual-channel supply chain where a hotel faces two sources of consumers: One is from the hotel’s front desk and the other
is from an online platform. They investigate the quantity decisions of rooms and supply chain coordination with cost-sharing contract, where the hotel shares the platform’s sales effort cost. They discover that the cost-sharing contract can coordinate the supply
chain. Considering the sales effort cost of a retailer, Pu et al. (2017) explore the pricing decisions of a dual-channel supply chain
where a manufacturer sells products through an offline retailer and an online channel. They further analyze the supply chain coordination with sales effort cost-sharing contract. They discover that this contract can coordinate the supply chain. Xie et al. (2018)
analyze the pricing and service effort level decisions of a dual-channel supply chain where a manufacturer shares a retailer’s collection cost on remanufactured products. They find that this contract can increase the profits of the offline channel and the online
channel. Zhou et al. (2018) investigate the pricing decisions of a dual-channel supply chain where a manufacturer sells products
through a traditional retailer and its own online channel. The retailer can promote the products and the manufacturer shares the
retailer’s sales effort cost. They discover that this contract can improve the level of sales effort. The above studies mainly investigate
the dual-channel supply chain where a manufacturer (hotel) sells products through a traditional retailer and its own online channel.
They consider the sale effort cost-sharing contract where the manufacturer shares the retailer’s sale effort cost. Different with these
studies, our work considers delivery cost-sharing contract where the platform shares the retailer’s delivery cost. Moreover, the online
platform collects a commission rate from and bring potential market to the retailer, which is different from the manufacturer’s own
online channel.
Table 1 shows the differences between our work and the most relevant literature.
3. Problem formulation
In this paper, we consider a supply chain consisting of an upstream manufacturer, a downstream retailer and an online platform.
The manufacturer supplies products to the retailer with a wholesale price and the retailer satisfies consumers’ demand by selling the
products through a traditional offline channel and an online platform (e.g. Amazon.com, Tmall.com) with the same retail price p . The
retailer invests on logistics technology to set the delivery time l , i.e., if a consumer makes an online order through the platform, he/
she can receive the product within time l . We model the operational decisions of the manufacturer (i.e. the wholesale price ) and the
retailer (i.e. the same retail price p and the delivery time l ) as a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer acts as the leader and the
retailer is the follower. The platform charges the retailer a commission for each product sold through the platform, with a commission
rate of the online revenue. For tractability reason, we assume that the commission rate is exogenous throughout this paper.
Similar treatment can be found in many articles studying similar problems (Abhishek et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2018, Yan et al., 2019)
The event sequence of this game is as follows. First, the manufacturer decides the wholesale price . Then, for a given commission
rate , the retailer determines the delivery time l and the retail price p . Backward induction is employed to solve for the equilibrium
results of the game.
Following Huang and Swaminathan (2009), Hua et al. (2010), Li et al. (2014), Saha et al. (2018) and Modak and Kelle (2019), we
assume that the retailer’s demand functions through the online platform and the offline channel are d1 d1and d2 d2 , respectively:

In the above demand functions, a and 1 are the potential market sizes of the online channel and offline channel, respectively. With
the rapid growth of online shopping, for many industries or giant retailers (such as Suning Group), the market size of online channel
becomes larger than that of offline channel. For example, in 2007, the market size of the electrical appliance market of online channel
in China has exceeded that of offline channel by 60% in the top 30 metropolises (Sun, 2007, Shen et al., 2019). Also, the market size
of online channel of Suning Group has exceeded that of its offline channel by 58% in 2018. Therefore, similar to Shen et al. (2019)
and Yi et al. (2019), we assume a 1, which means that joining the platform can bring a larger potential market compared to the
offline channel. As defined in the Introduction section, this new potential market size a is named “platform power” in this paper.
In the demand functions, denotes the consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time in the online channel. The cost of delivering
c
products to consumers is assumed to be a quadratic form (c0 c1 l) 2 with 0 l c0 (Savaskan and Van Wassenhove, 2006; Modak and
1
Kelle, 2019). The quadratic cost function is common used in the literature (Desiraju and Moorthy, 1997; Ma et al., 2013; Xu et al.,
2017a; Xie et al., 2018).
In reality, for the same product of the same retailer, the retail prices on the online channel and the offline channel are usually set
to be the same to avoid channel conflict. For example, Suning Group implements the same price policy for offline channel and online
channel. In theoretical research, more and more studies consider the same price for offline channel and online channel, such as Li
et al. (2016), Ji et al. (2017), Gao and Su (2017a, 2017b), Xie et al. (2018) and Zhou et al. (2018). Actually, setting the same price for
) p > w to make sure that the
multiple channels is a trend for omni-channel retail in recent years. In addition, we assume (1
retailer can get positive profits from the two channels. This assumption is widely used in the literature, e.g., Chen et al. (2012), Zhang
et al. (2015), Li et al. (2016), He and Zhao (2016) and Shen et al. (2019) Table 2 summarizes the related parameters.
4. Model analysis
In this section, we first investigate the operational decisions of the manufacturer and the retailer with wholesale price contract
and delivery cost-sharing contract, respectively; later we discuss whether the two contracts can coordinate the supply chain. To verify
the robustness of our results, we then extend the model to a new supply chain structure, i.e., the manufacturer rather than the retailer
opens a direct sales online channel on the platform.
4.1. The optimal operational decisions with wholesale price contract

channels by maximizing its total profit as follows:

Theorem 1 shows that the optimal operational decisions of the manufacturer and the retailer depend on the commission rate. If
the commission rate is lower than 0 , the retailer is willing to compress the delivery time to zero. The reason is that the retailer, who
retains a large share of the revenue from the online platform, prefers to set a minimum delivery time in order to increase its sales. This
result can explain why many retailers provide some logistics service with very short delivery time. For example, as mentioned in the
Introduction section, Suning Group provides the service called “Jisuda” to deliver its online products within two hours, even less than
five minutes, which is nearly zero. If the commission rate is higher than that threshold, the delivery time is increasing in the
wholesale price. It occurs because with high commission rate, as the wholesale price increases, the retailer’s marginal profit decreases
fast, which force the retailer to prolong the delivery time.
2c1, the optimal retail price increases when the
Theorem 1 also shows that, if the sensitivity of delivery time is low, i.e.
wholesale price increases. It is obvious that, for a higher wholesale price, the retailer sets a higher retail price to obtain more profits.
However, if consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time is high, i.e., > 2c1, the relationship between the optimal retail price and the
wholesale price depends on the commission rate. If the commission rate is low (0 < < 0 ) or high ( > 1 4c12 2 ), the retail price
1 4c12 2 , the optimal retail price
increases when the wholesale price increases. If the commission rate is moderate, i.e., 0 <
decreases while the optimal wholesale price increases. Under this situation, the retailer hopes to transfer some sales from the platform
channel to the offline channel. With the increase of the wholesale price, the retailer reduces the retail price to increase the demand in
order to increase the retailer’s profits.
Intuitively, when the manufacturer increases the wholesale price, the retailer should also increase its retail price. This conclusion
can be widely found in the literature, such as Cao (2014) and Shen et al. (2019). However, we interestingly find that the retail price
and the wholesale price changes in opposite directions under moderate commission rate. Hence, when the platform increases its
commission rate to a moderate level, the manufacturer should decrease the wholesale price, as can be seen in following Proposition 1,
but the retailer should increase its retail price. Specially, if the retailer establishes its own website rather than joins the platform,
which is a special case of our work (i.e., = 0), the retailer should also increase its retail price when the wholesale price increases.
We still take Suning Group as an example. Before 2015, Suning Group only has its own website “Suning.com”. In that case, if the
wholesale price increases, Suning Group should increase its retail price. After 2015, Suning Group opens a new online channel on
Tmall.com. Then, if Tmall.com increases its commission rate from a low value to a relatively high value, then the manufacturer
should decrease its wholesale price while Suning Group should increase its retail price.

Proposition 1(1) shows that, the wholesale price decreases when the commission rate increases. With the increase of the commission rate, the retailer has less profit earned from the online channel, which declines the demand of online channel. In order to
induce the retailer to order more products, the manufacturer reduces its wholesale price. This finding is easy to understand, which is
also found in Tian et al. (2018), Yan et al. (2018) and Shen et al. (2019).
Proposition 1(2) shows that, if the commission rate is low, the wholesale price increases when consumers’ sensitivity to delivery
time increases. Under this situation, the retailer retains a large share of the revenue from online channel. Hence, with the increase of
consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time, the retailer is willing to compress delivery time, which can increase the online demand. At
this moment, the manufacturer can increase the wholesale price to obtain more profits. This result has also been found in the existing
studies, such as Modak and Kelle (2019). However, we interestingly find that if the commission rate is relatively high, the wholesale
price will decrease when consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time increases. The reason for this is similar to the situation when the
commission rate is relatively low. It is acknowledged that consumers are more and more sensitive to the delivery time (Pekgün et al.,
2017; Ding et al., 2018). Hence, if the commission rate is low, the manufacturer should increase its wholesale price; otherwise, the
manufacturer should decrease its wholesale price. It is worth noting that, when the retailer establishes its own website to sell the
products, the manufacturer can increase the wholesale price when consumers are more sensitive to delivery time.

Since the analytical expressions of the optimal retail price and the delivery time are difficult to be calculated, we conduct
numerical studies in Section 5 to show these two decision variables. Similar treatment can be found in existing studies, such as Hua
et al. (2010). Theorem 1 indicates that, the optimal retail price, wholesale price and delivery time are affected by the platform power.
Proposition 2 gives a detailed result.

Proposition 2(1) indicates that the platform power has a positive effect on the wholesale price, the retail price, the demand of the
platform channel and the total demand. However, the platform power has a negative effect on the demand of the offline channel.
Obviously, the increase of platform power can increase the online demand, which induces the increase of the wholesale price and the
retail price. The increase of the wholesale price can reduce the offline demand. Proposition 2(1) has some implications. (a) The
increase of platform power can intensify double marginalization. (b) Although the retailer implements the same retail price for offline
channel and online channel, the increase of platform power encroaches on the demand of offline channel. (c) Combined with
equations 3–5, we can easily verify that the profits of the manufacturer, the retailer and the platform increase with the platform
power, which can explain why Tmall.com invests a lot of money every year to improve the platform power.
Proposition 2(2) shows that, the optimal delivery time may increase with the platform power when the commission rate is
moderate. When the commission rate is low, the increase of the platform power can increase the retailer’s marginal profit, who is
willing to compress the delivery time. When the commission rate is high, the platform grasps relatively high marginal profit. As a
result, the retailer gets less marginal profit and has less motivation to compress the delivery time. Proposition 2 (2) indicates that the
increase of platform power can weaken the double marginalization when the commission rate is high.
4.2. The optimal operational decisions with delivery cost-sharing contract
In this subsection, we consider the optimal decisions of the supply chain members with delivery cost-sharing contract. With
delivery cost-sharing contract, the manufacturer supplies the products to the retailer with a wholesale price . And then the retailer
sells the products through the offline channel and the platform channel. The platform not only takes a commission rate but also
shares a proportion of the retailer’s delivery cost (c0 c1 l) 2 . With delivery cost-sharing contract, the profits of the retailer, the
manufacturer and the platform are given as follows:

Then we can obtain the optimal operational decisions with delivery-cost sharing contract, as shown in the following theorem.

The results of Theorem 2 are similar to Theorem 1. However, the cost-sharing proportion directly affects the wholesale price, as
shown in the following proposition.

Proposition 3 shows that, when the commission rate is low, the wholesale price increases when the cost-sharing proportion
increases. The low value of commission rate and the increase of the cost-sharing proportion induce the retailer to sell more products
7

Transportation Research Part E 141 (2020) 101990

X. Xu, et al.

through online channel. Then the manufacturer can increase its wholesale price for more profit. However, we interestingly find that
the wholesale price decreases when the cost-sharing proportion increases, if the commission rate is high. Since the platform implements high commission rate, the retailer has the motivation to reduce the online sales despite the fact that the platform shares
more delivery cost. Therefore, the manufacturer decreases its wholesale price in order to induce more demand.
4.3. Supply chain coordination with the two contracts
In this subsection, we analyze the conditions to coordinate the supply chain in two steps. In the first step, we solve for the optimal
delivery time and pricing decision in the centralized supply chain. In the second step, we study the supply chain coordination results
with wholesale price contract and delivery cost-sharing contract, respectively.
The total profit of the centralized supply chain is given by

With simple calculation based on Theorem 3, we can find that, if consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time is relatively low, the
optimal delivery time and the supply chain’s total profit decreases when this sensitivity increases. With increased sensitivity to
delivery time, it is necessary for the supply chain members to compress the delivery time. However, compressing the delivery time
will increase the total delivery cost which further reduces the profit of the supply chain. On the contrary, if consumers’ sensitivity to
delivery time is very high, the retailer has incentive to reduce the delivery time to zero. This result is intuitive.
Theorem 3 also indicates that, the retail price and the profit of the centralized supply chain increase when the platform power
increases. This result shows that the increase of the platform power is beneficial to the total supply chain.
In the following two subsections, we discuss the supply chain coordination problem with wholesale price contract and delivery
cost-sharing contract. In reality, the commission rate is very low. For example, Tmall.com sets the commission rate to be no more
than 5%. Therefore, for simplification, we give the following assumption in the following two subsections.

4.3.1. Coordination via wholesale price contract
In this subsection, we discuss whether wholesale price contract can coordinate the supply chain. We design a wholesale price
contract ( cw , l cw ) , where cw and lcw are the wholesale price and the delivery time. If this contract can coordinate the supply chain, it
should be true that the delivery time and retail price under this contract are the same as those in the centralized supply chain, i.e.,
lcw = l c , pcw = pc .
Let lcw = l c . We have the retailer’s profit with wholesale price contract as follows:

The response function of the retailer with respect to the wholesale price is

Then, in order to let pcw = pc , we must have

In addition,

.

In traditional supply chains, it is usually found that the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain due to the
double marginalization (Cachon and Kök, 2010; Xu et al., 2017a). Proposition 4 shows that whether the wholesale price contract can
coordinate the supply chain depends on the platform power. When the platform power is small, the wholesale price contract cannot
coordinate the supply chain. But when the platform power is large, the wholesale price contract can coordinate the supply chain.
Recall that Proposition 2 implies that the increase of platform power intensifies the double marginalization. However, Theorem 3
tells us that the increase of platform power can increase the profit of the supply chain. Combining Proposition 2 with Proposition 4,
we discover that: (1) when the platform power is small, its impact on intensifying double marginalization is larger than that on
increasing the profit of the supply chain; (2) when the platform power is great, the opposite is true. It is worth noting that, when
a = 1, the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. That means, for the traditional dual-channel supply chain, the
wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. Proposition 4 implies that the manufacturer, the retailer and the
8

Transportation Research Part E 141 (2020) 101990

platform should cooperate to increase the platform power.
4.3.2. Coordination via delivery cost-sharing contract
In this subsection, we discuss whether a delivery cost-sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain. We design a delivery costsharing contract ( c , , l c ) , where
is the proportion that the platform shares the retailer’s delivery cost, c and lc are the
wholesale price and the delivery time under this contract. The retailer’s profit with this contract is as follows:

Proposition 5 shows that, whether delivery cost-sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain depends on the platform power
and consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time. Proposition 5(1) indicates that, when the platform power and the sensitivity are relatively
low, delivery cost-sharing contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. The reason is that the retailer cannot get positive profit from
c < 0 . Proposition 5 indicates that the increase of platform power and consumers’ sen) pc
the online platform, that is, (1
sitivity to delivery time can promote the supply chain coordination. Hence, it is necessary for the supply chain members to cooperate
with each other to increase the platform power. In reality, Tmall.com established “Cainiao” logistics network in 2013 to shorten the
delivery time so that it can meet consumers’ increasing online demand. Also, Tmall.com invests a lot of money every year to attract
more consumers to purchase products through the platform. Proposition 5 implies that these arrangements of Tmall.com are beneficial to the whole supply chain.
From Propositions 4 and 5, we find that, when wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain (i.e., 1 a a1), the
supply chain members can try to use the delivery cost-sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain under a high value of consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time. When delivery cost-sharing contract cannot coordinate the supply chain (i.e., 1 a a2 and
2c1) , the supply chain members can try to use wholesale price contract to coordinate the supply chain whena1 a a2 . It
indicates that neither contract always has more advantages compared to the other one in supply chain coordination.
4.4. Supply chain coordination when the manufacturer joins the platform
To examine the robustness of our results, in this section, we extend the previous model to the case that the manufacturer rather
than the retailer opens a direct sales channel on the platform. In this case, the manufacturer invests on the logistics technology and
determines the delivery time on the online channel. The platform charges the manufacturer the commission for the online channel it
brings to the manufacturer.
In centralized case, the total profit of the new supply chain is the same as that of the former supply chain, i.e., equation (9).
However, in decentralized case, the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer are new. We study the two contracts in this new
supply chain structure, respectively.
If a wholesale price contract is applied to this new supply chain, the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer are as follows:
w1
m

= (1

) pd1 + d2

w1
r

= (p

) d2.

(c0

(12)

c1 l ) 2

(13)

Following the same process in proving Proposition 4, we analyze the coordination of the supply chain in two cases: One is that the
manufacturer determines the retail price, and the other is that the retailer determines the retailer price. We find that the conditions
for a wholesale contract to coordinate the supply chain are exactly the same as those in Proposition 4. This implies that: (1) no matter
the manufacturer or the retailer joins the online platform, the conditions for coordinating the supply chain are the same; (2) when the
manufacturer joins the online platform, no matter the manufacturer or the retailer determines the retail price, the conditions for
coordinating the supply chain are also the same. Therefore, in terms of supply chain coordination, there is no difference for the
manufacturer or the retailer to join the online platform. Besides, there is also no difference for the manufacturer or the retailer to

Therefore, when the retailer joins the online platform and the supply chain cannot be coordinated (i.e., 1 a a2 , and
the manufacturer join the online platform can coordinate the supply chain if a1 a a2 . In reality, consumers are more and more
sensitive to the delivery time, which means a relatively high value of the sensitivity to delivery time (i.e., > 2c1). That is, when the
retailer joins the online platform, delivery cost-sharing contract can always coordinate the supply chain. However, if the manufacturer joins the online platform, the supply chain can be coordinated when 1 a a1. Therefore, to let the retailer join the online
platform is beneficial to the supply chain coordination.
5. Numerical study
In order to better illustrate and verify our theoretic results, we in this section conduct a set of numerical studies with the data from
Anhui Truelove Food Group and Anhui Xinerlian Company. Anhui Truelove Food Group produces its products and sells its products
to Anhui Xinerlian Company, which has two channels, one offline and one online (through Tmall.com). We collect the data of the
retail price, the sales in both channels and the delivery time on the online channel (Tmall.com). The data collected cover the time
period from May 2018 to November 2018. With the method of regression analysis, we derive the relationship of the online sales with
respect to the retail price and delivery time, and the relationship of the offline sales with respect to the retail price, which are
presented in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. Based on the regression, we formulate the online demand function as
d1 = 312 11p 16l . By standardizing the coefficient of the retail price, we have d1 = 28 p 1.5l . Similarly, we formulate the
offline demand function as d2 = 10 p . We further standardize the market size, and obtain the demands of the online channel and
offline channel as follows: d1 = 2.8 p 1.5l and d2 = 1 p , that meansa = 2.8 and = 1.5. According to our survey, Tmall.com
charges Anhui Xinerlian Company a commission rate of 2% on the revenue sold through its platform. Therefore, we set = 0.02 .
5.1. The impact of consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time on the optimal decisions
We examine the impact of consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time on the optimal retail price and the optimal delivery time in
decentralized supply chain with wholesale price contract. We suppose a = 2.8, c0 = 1, c1 = 0.8 and focus on the impact of consumers’
sensitivity to delivery time on the optimal delivery time and retail price, which is presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively.
Fig. 1 shows that, the optimal delivery time decreases when consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time increases. Since consumers are
more and more sensitive to the delivery time, it is necessary for Anhui Xinerlian Company to compress its delivery time, which can
further increase its profits. Fig. 2 shows that, the optimal retail price firstly decreases and then increases when consumers’ sensitivity

to delivery time increases. Based on Fig. 2, we find that when = 0.02, d < 0 if 0 < < 1.7 , and d > 0 if > 1.7. When = 0.05,

Anhui Xinerlian Company, we have = 1.5. Therefore, with consumers’ increasing sensitivity to delivery time, the company should
firstly decrease and then increase the retail price.

5.2. The impact of the platform power on coordination with wholesales price contract
In this subsection, we set c0 = 1 and c1 = 0.8. From Proposition 4, we know that if the platform power is relatively small, wholesale
price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. If the platform power is relatively great, wholesale price contract can coordinate

the supply chain, which are presented in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3 shows that, for = 0.02 and = 0.10 , wholesale price contract can coordinate the supply chain when a > 1.99 . Based on the
data of Anhui Xinerlian Company, we have a = 2.8 and = 0.02. Thus we find that wholesale price contract can coordinate the supply
chain of Anhui Truelove Food Group. The total profit of the supply chain before and after coordination is 0.8039 and 0.8308,
respectively. Therefore, the total profit of the coordinated supply chain is about 2% higher than that of the pre-coordinated supply
chain. After the coordination, the profits of the platform and the retailer increase by 19.77% and 636.89%, respectively. However, the
manufacturer’s profit decreases by 98%. It means that to coordinate the supply chain has to sacrifice the manufacturer’s profit. Since
the total profit of the supply chain increases by 2%, the manufacturer, the retailer and the platform can achieve a win-win result by
pre-arranged agreement, such as a two-part tariff agreement, which can be found in Chen et al. (2012), Zhang et al. (2015) and Xu
et al. (2017a). Here we let F1, F2 be the lump sum fees that the manufacturer charges the platform and the retailer, respectively. The
three members can achieve a win-win result if F1 (0, 0.0052) and F2 (0.6585 F1, 0.6802) .
5.3. The impact of the platform power on coordination with delivery cost-sharing contract
Based on the data of Anhui Xinerlian Company, we have the threshold of the condition in Proposition 5 as a2 = 3.26. According to
Proposition 5, the delivery cost-sharing contract can always coordinate the supply chain when a > 3.26, we only conduct the analysis
when 1 < a < 3.26. Also, we have = 1.5 2c1 = 1.6. According to Proposition 5, the delivery cost-sharing contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. Fig. 4(a) verifies this result. However, since consumers are increasingly sensitive to the delivery time, the
result can be changed in the future, as shown in Fig. 4(b), where = 1.65. In that case, the delivery cost-sharing contract can
coordinate the supply chain. Therefore, based on the data of Anhui Xinerlian Company, the delivery cost-sharing contract cannot
coordinate the supply chain. But this company can cooperate with Tmall.com to compress the delivery time in order to attain
customers due to their increasing sensitivity to delivery time.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate the optimal operational decisions and coordination problem of a supply chain consisting of a
manufacturer, a retailer and an online platform. Specifically, we examine two contracts: wholesale price contract and delivery costsharing contract. By exploring the optimal operational decisions with Stackelberg game models, we have the following findings. (1) If
consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time is high and the platform’s commission rate is moderate, the optimal wholesale price and
optimal retail price changes in opposite directions. (2) If the commission rate is low (high), the optimal wholesale prices with the two
contracts increase (decrease) when consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time and the cost-sharing proportion increase. (3) When the
12

Transportation Research Part E 141 (2020) 101990

X. Xu, et al.

platform power increases, the wholesale price, the retail price, the online demand and the total demand increase. However, the
offline demand decreases. Moreover, the increase of the platform power intensifies the double marginalization but increases the
profits of the manufacturer, the retailer and the platform. (4) The optimal delivery time may increase with the platform power when
the commission rate is moderate.
By exploring the supply chain coordination with wholesale price and delivery cost-sharing contracts, we find the following results.
With wholesale price contract, (1) the supply chain can be coordinated only when the platform power is greater than a threshold; (2)
no matter the manufacturer or the retailer joins the online platform, the conditions to coordinate the supply chain are the same; (3)
when the manufacturer joins the online platform, no matter the manufacturer or the retailer determines the retail price, the conditions to coordinate the supply chain are also the same. With delivery cost-sharing contract, (1) when the platform power is small,
the supply chain can be coordinated if the sensitivity of delivery time is high, and when the platform power is large, the supply chain
can always be coordinated; (2) when the manufacturer joins the platform, no matter the manufacturer or the retailer determines the
retail price, the conditions to coordinate the supply chain are the same with those for wholesale price contract.
Based on the analysis in this paper, we discover some managerial insights. (1) When the platform increases its commission rate to
be moderate, the manufacturer should decrease the wholesale price, but the retailer should increase its retail price. (2) When the
retailer relies on its own website to sell the products, the manufacturer can increase the wholesale price when consumers’ sensitivity
to delivery time increases. However, when the retailer joins an online platform, the manufacturer should decrease the wholesale price
when consumers’ sensitivity to delivery time increases if the platform charges a relatively high commission rate. (3) The manufacturer, the retailer and the platform should cooperate to increase the platform power because that can further increase their profits.
(4) In terms of the conditions for wholesale price contract to coordinate the supply chain, there is no difference for the manufacturer
or the retailer to join the online platform. (5) In terms of the conditions for the two contracts to coordinate the supply chain, if the
manufacturer joins the online platform, there is no difference for the manufacturer or the retailer to determine the retail price.
There are several limitations of our work, and some of them may be possible directions for further research. First, the online
platform in this supply chain may operate with reselling mode. That is, the retailer sells its products to the platform, who further sells
to consumers. Considering an online platform operating with reselling mode may lead to many new findings. Second, in this work, the
manufacturer acts as the leader of the Stackelberg games. If the retailer acts as the leader, the results may be much different. This is
also an interesting research direction. Finally, in this work we implicitly assume information symmetry between the manufacturer
and the retailer. Considering the information asymmetry between the two firms may also be an interesting direction.
