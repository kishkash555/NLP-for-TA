The supply chain dimension of an EM is largely neglected and poorly managed, while basic logistics operation is currently hampering turnover and revenues. The Paper at hand examines, based on a critical literature review, the actual EM discussion and calls for more supply chain management research within this field.","2003-01-16","2021-01-04 08:58:02","2021-01-04 13:23:17","2021-01-04 08:58:02","280-294","","2","144","","European Journal of Operational Research","Electronic marketplaces","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/siegman/Zotero/storage/74WVQYTZ/Grieger - 2003 - Electronic marketplaces A literature review and a.pdf; /home/siegman/Zotero/storage/ATMZ3LXW/S0377221702003946.html","","","Electronic business; Electronic commerce; Electronic marketplaces; Information technology; Relationships; Supply chain management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P2P marketplaces can mitigate consumers' risk by allowing them to trade mismatched goods; yet, they also impose a threat to retailers and their suppliers as they compete over consumers. Further, do profit-maximizing marketplaces always extract the entire consumer surplus from the online trades? Our two-period model highlights the effects introduced by P2P marketplaces while accounting for the platform's pricing decisions. We prove that with low product unit cost, the P2P marketplace sets its transaction fee to the market clearing price, thereby extracting all of the seller surplus. In this range of product unit cost, the supply chain partners are worse off due to the emergence of a P2P marketplace. However, when the unit cost is high, the platform sets its transaction fee to be less than the market clearing price, intentionally leaving money on the table, as a mechanism to stimulate first period demand for new goods in expectation for some of them to be traded later, in the second period, via the marketplace. It is not until the surplus left with the sellers is sufficiently high that the supply chain partners manage to extract some of this surplus, ultimately making them better off due to a P2P marketplace. We further analyze the impact of a P2P marketplace on consumer surplus and social welfare. In addition, we consider model variants accounting for a frictionless platform and consumer strategic waiting.","2017","2021-01-04 08:59:34","2021-01-04 08:59:34","2021-01-04 08:59:34","509-524","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 Production and Operations Management Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12653","","/home/siegman/Zotero/storage/8E7FY9JR/poms.html","","","backward induction; consumers' valuation risk; P2P marketplace; retailing strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to acting as traditional merchants (buying and reselling goods), these retailers provide a platform for third-party (3P) sellers to access and compete for the same customers. We investigate the strategic rationale for a retailer to introduce a 3P marketplace. Our analysis provides insights into the growing prevalence of 3P marketplaces. We show that by committing to having an active 3P marketplace, the retailer creates an “outside option” that improves its bargaining position in negotiations with the manufacturer. This can explain the increasing prevalence of such marketplaces. On the other hand, the manufacturer would prefer to eliminate the retailer's outside option and should seek to limit or prevent sales through 3P marketplaces. This is consistent with actions that several manufacturers have taken to limit such sales. Interestingly, if the manufacturer fails to eliminate sales of competing products through the 3P marketplace, then the best strategy for the manufacturer is to allow the retailer to dictate the terms of their contract. This is because a powerful retailer will rely less on its outside option in generating profit, and therefore it will increase the fees charged to 3P sellers and soften the competition between 3P sellers and the manufacturer. The decrease in competition will lead to an increase in the value of outside option of the manufacturer and improve its profit. Additionally, we find that the presence of a 3P marketplace benefits consumers, but this benefit diminishes as the retailer becomes more powerful.","2014","2021-01-04 09:01:19","2021-01-04 13:23:55","2021-01-04 09:01:19","1937-1949","","11","23","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 Production and Operations Management Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12203","","/home/siegman/Zotero/storage/AV2PQ957/poms.html","","","bargaining; dual-format retailing; internet retailing; marketing channels; third-party marketplaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These marketplaces serve as an intermediary, matching buyers with sellers, whereas control of the good is left to the seller. In some cases, e.g., the Amazon marketplace system, the firm that owns and manages the marketplace system will also sell competing products through the marketplace system. This creates a new form of channel conflict, which is a focus of this article. We consider a setting in which a marketplace firm operates an online marketplace through which retailers can sell their products directly to consumers. We consider a single retailer, who currently sells its product only through its own website, but who may choose to contract with Amazon to sell its product through the marketplace system. Selling the product through the marketplace expands the available market for the retailer, but comes at some expense, e.g., a fixed participation fee or a revenue sharing requirement. Thus, a key question for the retailer is whether she should choose to sell through the marketplace system, and if so, at what price. We analyze the optimal decisions for both the retailer and the marketplace firm and characterize the system equilibrium.","2012","2021-01-04 09:02:05","2021-01-04 13:24:09","2021-01-04 09:02:05","997-1014","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2012 Production and Operations Management Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01332.x","","/home/siegman/Zotero/storage/63GRN57F/j.1937-5956.2012.01332.html","","","competition; coordination; e-Business; game theory; online marketplace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, these retailers have also started to serve as online marketplaces by providing a platform to directly connect sellers with buyers. Over and above re-shaping the traditional e-commerce market, conventional wisdom suggests that this new format will mitigate the double-marginalization effect and benefit both the intermediary and suppliers through a revenue sharing scheme. However, we find that upstream competition between suppliers critically moderates this possibility. We also find that the interaction of order-fulfillment costs and upstream competition intensity moderates the selection of an optimal mode for the intermediary. More specifically, when order-fulfillment costs are large and when the supplier product offerings are similar (i.e., competition intensity is high), the pure reseller mode is the preferred choice; when order-fulfillment costs are small and the supplier product offerings are highly differentiated (i.e., low competition intensity), the pure marketplace mode is the preferred choice. Finally, the hybrid mode is preferred when order-fulfillment costs are moderate and suppliers’ products are somewhat similar (i.e., competition intensity is moderate). The intuition behind these results hinges on the trade-off between transfer of pricing rights and the responsibility for order fulfillment. Our findings not only complement the emerging online marketplace literature but also provide testable empirical questions concerning the relationship and magnitude of different factors steering the mode choice.","2018","2021-01-04 09:03:40","2021-01-04 13:24:23","2021-01-04 09:03:40","1595-1610","","8","27","","","Marketplace, Reseller, or Hybrid","","","","","","","en","© 2018 Production and Operations Management Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12885","","/home/siegman/Zotero/storage/ILMZW79E/poms.html","","","channel structure; online marketplace; order-fulfillment cost; upstream competition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it endows upstream manufacturers with direct access to consumers, it also requires them to personally perform sales work, which is not their strength, especially in the form of sales efficiency and demand information. In this paper, we apply a stylized theoretical model to examine whether the manufacturer and e-tailer should agree to introduce the marketplace channel by considering these dual upstream disadvantages. We present an interesting insight that the marketplace channel should be introduced under not only a low degree but also a high degree of upstream sales inefficiency, which also means that a weak direct channel would not necessarily become a burden for the two. Actually, here, its introduction leads to higher output, a lower wholesale price and a lower retail price, thus benefiting both the supply chain members and the overall economy. In contrast, we find that only when the upstream informational disadvantage is moderate can the two reach consensus and introduce the marketplace channel. These findings, counterintuitively, demonstrate the entirely different effects of two types of upstream disadvantage in the equilibrium channel structure. Further, we also illustrate how the manufacturer’s two disadvantages interact with one another; a manufacturer with higher sales efficiency can screen information early, while a manufacturer with low sales efficiency has to suffer longer from poor demand information.","2019-03-16","2021-01-04 09:05:30","2021-01-04 13:24:48","2021-01-04 09:05:30","968-982","","3","273","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/siegman/Zotero/storage/6NETMAS9/Yan et al. - 2019 - Strategic introduction of the marketplace channel .pdf; /home/siegman/Zotero/storage/ECKES8JY/S0377221718307987.html","","","Dual-channel distribution; Game theory; Online retailing; Retailing; Supply channel structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
